**What still requires admin panel:**
- Suppressed address management (SuppressedAddress model)
- Email send/receive log review (EmailSendLog, InboundEmailLog — read-only)
- SLA Plans, Help Topics, KB Categories (admin-managed)
- Roles and TechSkills management
- Credential access log review (CredentialAccessLog — read-only, audit only)

**Note**: All routine workflow actions (create client, work order, device, contact) now use native app pages. The Django admin is staff-only config/reference only.

## Vision & Philosophy

Murphy's Bench is **internal-first, self-hosted software** for small field service businesses (MSPs).

### Core Principle
Build one thing well: a self-hosted repair tracking system that runs on a business's internal network. Other companies can self-host it on their infrastructure.

### Workflow
```
Ticket (intake + replies) → Triage → Work Order (repair) → Notes/Checklist → Closed → Invoice Ninja
```

### Phase 1: SCS Internal (Current)
- **Focus**: Get SCS's workflow working perfectly
- **Scope**: Ticketing, work orders, device tracking, mileage, email integration, reporting
- **Deployment**: Internal network
- **Success**: SCS techs prefer this to the legacy PHP app

### Phase 2: Integrations & Polish (Future)
- Org-level credentials vault (OrgCredential + CredentialAccessLog)
- Device-level credentials (password field on Device, encrypted)
- Email Template Manager UI, Status Management UI, Data Management (import/export/deleted/reset)
- Financial reporting (invoiced/paid/outstanding by client)
- Invoice Ninja API bridge
- Email OAuth2 (Gmail/Office 365)
- Departments, Teams, Auto-routing
- Customer self-service portal
- REST API (for Taskbar Utility App / Clover integration)

### Phase 3+: Multi-Tenancy (Speculative)

---

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11 / Django 4.2.30
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS (CDN), HTMX, Alpine.js
- **Database**: SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (planned for production)
- **Auth**: Django session auth + django-two-factor-auth (TOTP), LoginRequiredMixin on all views

## Ticketing System Design

See `docs/ticketing-design.md` for full detail.

### Ticket Statuses
`new` → `open` → `in_progress` → `waiting_on_customer` → `resolved` → `closed`
Also: `converted` (converted to Work Order — read-only after this point)

### Ticket → Work Order Rules
- A ticket linked to an open WO **cannot** be closed/resolved — hard block
- When the WO closes, ticket shows a prompt: "WO complete — ready to resolve" — tech closes manually
- `AUTO_RESOLVE_TICKET_ON_WO_CLOSE` admin setting (default **off**)
- Ticket remains in system after conversion — full history retained

---

- **P3**: Native Settings UI at `/settings/` — 6 tabs: Company, Outbound Email, Inbound Email, Attachments, Security, Mileage

### ✅ Batch 11 — Foundational Client-Centric Rebuild (sessions 10–11 — COMPLETE)

Full spec in `docs/batch-11-plan.md`. Identified by complete side-by-side audit of the legacy
PHP app (SCS Repair Tracker) vs Murphy's Bench. Core problem: Murphy's Bench treats Clients,
Contacts, Devices, and Work Orders as peer objects. The legacy app — and correct workflow — is
**client-centric**: everything flows through the client.

**Priority 1 — Device + Client Hub:**
- Device model: add `os`, `os_version`, `condition_at_intake`, `assigned_contact` FK, "Save & Create WO" button. Remove Device from top-level nav.
- WorkOrder: add `contact` FK (nullable) — "whose WO is this?" Shown in WO History, WO detail header, WO create/edit form.
- Client detail as hub: single-column layout, per-contact "+ WO" button, inline device add, phone custom label + type dropdown, inline client type edit, Set Primary Contact.
- Client edit: Deactivate (block if WOs on delete) + Permanently Delete (type-to-confirm).

**Priority 2 — WO Detail + Print:**
- Unified black action toolbar: View Client | Edit Client | Edit Device | Edit WO | WO History | Repair Report | Claim Ticket | Email Report | Status ▼
- Client info + Device info (OS, serial, condition) on WO page.
- Days Open counter, Completed Date, Invoice Ninja Ref #.
- Work Performed entries show bold label + description + timestamp.
- Pre/Post Checklist collapsed by default. Credentials "+ Add note" field.
- Repair Report: add OS/version/condition, note timestamps, signature lines, footer.
- Claim Ticket: same template, `?type=claim` changes title only.

**Priority 3 — Native Settings UI Expansion:**
- Repair Types: native CRUD with categories + ▲/▼ reorder. Needs new `RepairTypeCategory` model.
- Canned Responses: two Note Streams (Customer Notes / Tech Notes Internal), categories per stream, CRUD, picker on WO detail.
- Quick Labor: native CRUD (currently Django admin only).
- Checklist Items: model change — flat bank scoped by device type (not per-repair-type). Migration required.
- Status Colors + Site Colors: hex inputs + live preview, stored in SiteSettings, rendered as CSS variables in base.html.
- Company Info: split address into Line 1, Line 2, City, State, Zip (both SiteSettings and Client model). Report Header Preview.
- Display Settings: browser-local UI preferences (localStorage) — nav/sidebar/content font size, card density (Compact/Normal/Comfortable).

**Decisions locked in session 9:**
- Permanently Delete blocks if client has WOs; offers Deactivate instead
- Address: 5 fields (Line 1, Line 2 optional, City, State, Zip) — no country field
- Existing address data migrates to Line 1; user cleans up manually
- Colors stored in SiteSettings; rendered as `<style>` block of CSS variables in base.html
- RepairTypeCategory model needs to be created with sort_order field
- Device assigned_contact: server-side queryset filter (client_id from URL param); no HTMX cascade needed (standalone Device page being removed)

### ✅ Session 13 — Cross-Visibility + Bug Fixes (session 13 — COMPLETE)

- **Cross-visibility panels**: Open tickets panel on WO detail; open WOs panel on ticket detail — status, last note/reply preview, one-click navigation
- WO detail toolbar: linked ticket shown as clickable purple pill (← TKT-XXXXX)
- Converted tickets stay visible in sidebar, dashboard "My Open Tickets" tile, and cross-visibility panels until resolved/closed
- History tab removed from ticket detail (consistent with WO detail)
- Sidebar: shows last reply/note preview instead of subject/description; falls back gracefully if no notes
- Mileage Calculate button: fixed CSRF token for production (was silently failing in prod)
- Google Maps API confirmed working from production server (WAN IP restriction set in Cloud Console)

### ✅ Session 22 — UI Polish, Dark Mode, KB Markdown (session 22 — COMPLETE)

- **Search bars inline**: Tickets, Work Orders, Clients, Mileage, KB lists — filter controls moved into page header bar. Fixed missing technician options in WO assigned_to dropdown.
- **Mileage decimal fix**: `floatformat:1` on total miles display.
- **Ticket reply type**: Radio buttons instead of dropdown. Removed redundant "Add Reply ↓" Quick Actions button.
- **KB Markdown rendering**: `markdown` library, `markdownify` template filter, Tailwind typography CDN plugin. Articles render headings/bold/lists/code/tables from pasted `.md` files.
- **KB Categories in Settings**: Native CRUD tab — no Django admin needed.
- **Dark mode**: Per-user toggle in sidebar footer (moon/sun icon), persisted to `localStorage`. CSS override strategy in `base.html` covers all common surfaces, text, borders, inputs, tinted panels (blue-50/yellow-50/green-50), prose.
- **My Work sidebar removed**: Was redundant in practice.
- **Dashboard stat cards**: Active Clients + Devices on File are now clickable links.

### ✅ Session 21 — Ticket Contact FK, Email Fixes, User/Role Management (session 21 — COMPLETE)

- **Ticket contact FK** (migration 0037): `Ticket.contact` nullable FK to `Contact`. Reply emails route to `ticket.contact.email` first, fall back to primary contact. Inbound emails auto-set contact from matched sender.
- **HTMX contact cascade on ticket form**: Client select dynamically loads contacts. Endpoint: `GET /tickets/contacts-by-client/?client=<id>`.
- **Reply resend**: Each customer-visible reply has a "Resend" button — pick any client contact or type a custom address.
- **CC on replies**: Reply form shows a CC field (comma-separated) when Customer Visible is selected.
- **Native User management**: `/users/new/`, `/users/<pk>/edit/`, `/users/<pk>/set-password/` — full CRUD, no Django admin needed.
- **Native Role management**: `/roles/` — list with ✓/✗ permission grid, create/edit/delete. 17 permission flags. System roles protected.
- **Users + Roles in Settings sidebar**: Both at the bottom of Settings nav, with "← Settings" back links.
- New template filters: `attr` (getattr on model), `getfield` (form[name]) — in `mb_icons.py`.

### ✅ Session 20 — Vertical Left Sidebar Nav (session 20 — COMPLETE)

- **Replaced horizontal top nav** with fixed left sidebar (`w-64` expanded / `w-16` collapsed to icon-only)
- **Logo** fills sidebar header at top (no company name text alongside it)
- **8 primary nav links** with icons: Dashboard (home), Work Orders (list), Clients (building), Tickets (ticket), Queues (funnel), Mileage (map-pin), KB (book-open), Reports (chart-bar). All `text-base` with active-page highlight.
- **My Work section** (HTMX accordion with tickets + WOs) integrated into scrollable sidebar middle — always loaded, hidden when collapsed
- **Footer**: Admin (admin-only → `/settings/`), Log Out. Security removed from sidebar.
- **Collapse toggle** (chevron) at bottom — state persisted to `localStorage`; pre-Alpine inline script + CSS attribute (`data-sidebar-collapsed`) prevents layout flash on page load
- **8 new icons** added to `mb_icons.py`: `home`, `map-pin`, `chart-bar`, `funnel`, `chevron-left`, `book-open`, `shield`, `logout`
- No model/migration changes. Deployed to production.

### ✅ Session 19 — Status Management UI (session 19 — COMPLETE)

- **`StatusDefinition` model**: `entity_type` (ticket/workorder), `slug`, `label`, `color` (hex bg), `is_system`, `sort_order`, `is_active`
- **Migration 0036**: AlterField removes choices= from Ticket.status and WorkOrder.status (max_length→50); seeds 13 core statuses with default colors; RunPython after CreateModel
- **Template tag suite** in `mb_icons.py`: `status_badge`, `status_label`, `status_color` — 2-min module-level cache, graceful fallback for unknown slugs. `invalidate_status_cache()` called after any CRUD change.
- **11 templates updated**: all hardcoded status badge `{% if status == ... %}bg-X{% endif %}` patterns replaced
- **WorkOrderForm + TicketForm**: status field overridden in `__init__` to load choices from StatusDefinition — custom statuses appear in dropdowns automatically
- **WorkOrderListView, TicketListView, WorkOrderDetailView**: pass status choices via context
- **Settings → Statuses tab**: two tables (Ticket / Work Order), color picker on each row, inline edit form (Alpine.js toggle), custom status add form at bottom, system statuses get "Edit Color" only
- **email_utils.py**: `status` context var resolved via StatusDefinition instead of `get_status_display()`
- Migration 0036 applied to production; all changes live

### ✅ Session 18 — Device Credentials Vault (session 18 — COMPLETE)

- **Device-level credentials**: `device_username`, `device_password`, `credential_notes` (AES-256 encrypted) added to `Device` model
- **`DeviceCredentialAccessLog`** model — logs every reveal (field + user) and edit
- **`can_view_device_credentials`** flag on `Role` (Administrator=True, Technician=False by default, configurable)
- **HTMX eye-reveal card** on device detail right column — masked by default, eye icon triggers HTMX GET, logs access
- Admin always sees edit form (Alpine.js toggle). Users with flag can reveal. Others see "contact admin" message.
- Migration 0035 applied to production. Administrator role seeded on prod.

### ✅ Session 17 — Phase 2 Foundations (session 17 — COMPLETE)

- **Invoice CSV export**: `InvoiceExportView` at `/clients/<pk>/invoices.csv` — all invoices for a client, optional `?status=` filter. CSV button on client detail WO History header.
- **Icon audit**: 10 new icons added to `mb_icons.py` (x-mark, exclamation-triangle, lock-closed, user, key, document-text, chevron-up/down/right, arrow-down-tray, eye). All emoji/text symbols replaced across templates. Fixed arrow-down-tray silently rendering nothing.
- **Billing financial summary on Reports page**: Invoiced/Collected/Outstanding metric cards + outstanding-by-client table with CSV links. Billing CSV export at `/reports/csv/billing/`.
- **Org credentials vault**: `OrgCredential` + `CredentialAccessLog` models (migration 0034). Settings → Credentials tab. AES-256 encrypted username/password/notes. HTMX eye-reveal logs every access. CRUD with admin-only flag. Every view/edit/delete written to audit log.
- **Email Template Manager**: Settings → Email Templates tab. Native UI for all 4 `EmailTemplate` triggers. Editable subject/body (monospace), active toggle, variable reference panel (`{% verbatim %}`), last-updated timestamp. Auto-creates inactive defaults on first visit.
- **Team workload widget**: Dashboard (admin only) — Team Workload table showing open WOs + tickets per tech, sorted by total load, counts link to filtered lists.
- **Technician performance report**: Reports page — WOs in period, completed count, completion % (color-coded), avg resolution hours, current open WOs. CSV export at `/reports/csv/tech_perf/`.
- **Doc sweep**: MB_UI_UX_Analysis.md content merged into CLAUDE.md + TODO.md. Stale admin panel entries cleaned up.
- Production deployed: migration 0034 applied, all changes live.

### ✅ Session 16 — Invoice Model (session 16 — COMPLETE)

- **`Invoice` model**: OneToOne on WorkOrder (`db_table = 'invoices'`). Fields: `billing_status` (uninvoiced/invoiced/paid/paid_direct/disputed), `amount`, `invoiced_date`, `paid_date`, `payment_method`, `notes`
- **Signal**: `post_save` on WorkOrder auto-creates Invoice on WO creation
- **Migration 0033**: CreateModel + `backfill_invoices` RunPython for existing WOs; applied to production
- **`WorkOrderBillingUpdateView`**: HTMX POST. Quick-action mode (just `billing_status`): updates status + auto-sets dates on first transition. Full edit mode (`full_edit=1`): updates all fields. Returns `billing_card.html` partial.
- **`billing_card.html`** partial: display mode shows status badge + amount + dates + quick-action buttons (contextual per status). Edit mode (Alpine.js toggle): full form. HTMX `hx-swap="outerHTML"` on `#billing-card`.
- **WO detail**: billing card inserted in right column between "Update Work Order" and "Device Credentials"
- **Client detail**: outstanding balance badge (yellow pill) next to "Work Order History" heading — sum of `uninvoiced`+`invoiced` WO amounts
- URL: `/work-orders/<pk>/billing/` → `wo_billing_update`
- Production deployed: migration 0033 applied, Gunicorn reloaded

### ✅ Session 15 — Visual Polish (session 15 — COMPLETE)

- **Color-coded dashboard tiles**: left-border accent per status (Blue=active, Yellow=waiting, Red=overdue, Green=completed). Color computed in `_tile_color()` from `status_filter` and `link_url`.
- **SVG icons replacing emoji**: all dashboard tiles and quick stats row now use Heroicons outline via `{% icon name size %}` templatetag (`core/templatetags/mb_icons.py`)
- **Device type icon grid**: replaced Device Type dropdown on device form with 2-row × 4-col Alpine.js button grid (Laptop, Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, Server, Printer, Other). Selected state highlighted blue.
- Migration 0032: data migration converting emoji icon values → icon name strings in DashboardTile
- Production deployed: migrations 0031 + 0032 applied, `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set in prod `.env`, Gunicorn reloaded

### ✅ Session 14 — Credential Encryption + Billing Architecture (session 14 — COMPLETE)

- **Credential encryption (migration 0031)**: `WorkOrder.device_username`, `device_password`, `device_pin`, `credential_notes` and `SiteSettings.email_password`, `inbound_password` now AES-256 encrypted at rest via `django-encrypted-model-fields` (Fernet symmetric encryption)
- `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` added to `murphys_bench/settings.py` — reads from env, dev fallback only
- `encrypted_model_fields` added to INSTALLED_APPS and `requirements.txt`
- `.env.example` updated with key generation instructions and warning
- RepairShopCRM comparative UI/UX analysis completed — documented in `MB_UI_UX_Analysis.md`
- **⚠️ Production deployment of migration 0031 is PENDING** — must set `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production `.env` BEFORE pulling. Must be done together. See `memory/project_credential_encryption_deploy.md`.

### ✅ Batch 12 — Production Deployment + WO Detail Polish (session 12 — COMPLETE)

**Deployment:**
- Ubuntu 24.04 VM on Proxmox (10.58.58.82), PostgreSQL 16, Gunicorn + Nginx, systemd
- Python 3.12 (Ubuntu 24.04 default), SSH key auth, config data migrated via dumpdata/loaddata

**WO Detail improvements:**
- Inline editing: Device card (reassign device), Details card (repair type, assigned to, scheduled date, contact, invoice ref)
- Custom repair type on the fly (＋ Custom… option in Details edit, get_or_create)
- Attachment upload form in Attachments tab (WorkOrderAttachmentUploadView)
- History tab removed from WO detail
- Work Performed redesign: editable entries (pencil/trash SVG icons), custom log form, collapsible Log Work buttons
- WorkPerformed model: labor_item nullable, custom_label + notes fields, ordered by logged_at
- Pre/Post Checklist: pre_check + post_check fields on WorkOrderItem, auto-saving dropdowns, color-coded rows, checked count in header
- Device Credentials: display-only by default, PIN masked like password, Edit toggle
- Add Note: radio buttons instead of dropdown for note type
- Quick Actions: removed redundant Add Note button

**Settings additions:**
- site_logo (ImageField), color_nav_text, color_sidebar_bg, color_sidebar_text in SiteSettings
- ColorSettingsForm expanded; base.html CSS variables updated; sidebar uses opacity-based text hierarchy
- Font size dropdowns (px values stored in localStorage)
- Client list redesigned to match legacy app layout (ACCOUNT/TYPE/CONTACT/PHONE/EMAIL/DEVICES/WOs)

### Remaining / Future
- **Testing suite** (deferred — will write after real-world use surfaces actual edge cases)
- **Cloudflare tunnel** — external access when ready
- **Site-wide icon audit** — replace remaining text symbols (×, etc.) with SVG icons

## Key Decisions Made

- **Tailwind via CDN** — no build step needed for now
- **LoginRequiredMixin on all views** — app is internal-only
- **Work order numbers** auto-generated as `WO-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`
- **Ticket numbers** auto-generated as `TKT-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`
- **SQLite for dev** — switch to PostgreSQL for production
- **Visual polish** — shipped session 15: color-coded dashboard tiles, SVG icons replacing emoji, device type icon grid
- **GitHub**: Private repo, push after each working feature
- **HTMX** for inline interactions (notes, replies, checklist toggling)
- **No Celery/async queue** — synchronous email sending is sufficient at MSP scale
- **No OAuth2** for email — SCS uses cPanel-hosted mail with standard IMAP/POP3 credentials
- **Single unified KB** — not split between tickets and work orders
- **Ticket close is always manual** even when linked WO closes — forces human contact
- **MFA backup codes for admin only** — other users recover via admin reset
- **SLA overdue alerts are in-app only** — acknowledgment with required note creates audit trail
- **Attachment storage Phase 1**: local filesystem (configurable path) + S3-compatible
- **Alpine.js** loaded via CDN in base.html with `defer` — required for sidebar accordion
- **Sidebar**: HTMX-loaded on every page except dashboard; admins see all, techs see own
- **`?assigned_to=me` filter**: works on both `/tickets/` and `/work-orders/`; admins see all
- **Credential encryption**: AES-256 via `django-encrypted-model-fields`. `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` read from env. Never plaintext. Migrations 0031 + 0032 applied to production (June 9, session 15). Key stored in Bitwarden.
- **Billing philosophy**: MB tracks billing state only — not an accounting module. Lightweight `Invoice` entity on WorkOrder (not fields on WO directly). `billing_status` enum: uninvoiced / invoiced / paid / paid_direct / disputed. `paid_direct` = cash/walk-in before formal invoice. Invoice Ninja and other systems remain authoritative for formal financials.
- **Visual design is a first-class requirement**: Color + icons communicate status faster than text. Not optional polish.
- **Modals for quick edits, full pages for complex creation**: Settings section edits, status changes, mark-as-paid → modal. New Ticket, New WO, New Client → full page form.
- **Soft-delete everything**: Hard deletes require deliberate admin action (type-to-confirm). No silent permanent deletes in normal operation.
- **Export-based integrations**: CSV export works with any accounting system. No live API sync until there is clear demand. More flexible and future-proof.
- **Org-level credentials vault is a competitive advantage**: RepairShopCRM has device-level credentials only, no audit trail. MB's org vault + access log is a differentiator — build it properly in Phase 2.
- **Status color convention**: Blue = In Progress/Active, Yellow = Waiting on Customer, Red = Overdue/Urgent, Green = Completed, Gray = New/Unassigned.
- **Audit log gotcha**: `changes_dict` can contain an `'items'` key that shadows `dict.items()` in Django templates. Always use `_audit_entries()` from views.py — never iterate `changes_dict.items` in templates.
- **Queue filter_criteria**: JSON dict with optional keys: `status` (list), `assigned_to` (int or null), `overdue` (bool), `client` (int), `help_topic` (int), `sla_plan` (int). The `assigned_to: null` key (explicit null, not absent) means "unassigned only".
- **Google Maps mileage**: API call is server-side via `MileageDistanceView` — key never sent to browser. Tested working in architecture; needs verification on internal server (outbound HTTPS required).
- **Service type on WorkOrder**: in_shop / onsite / remote. `+ Mileage` button appears on WO detail only when service_type == onsite.
- **two_factor template overrides** live in root `templates/two_factor/` (in DIRS), NOT in `core/templates/` — DIRS takes priority over APP_DIRS in Django's template loader.
