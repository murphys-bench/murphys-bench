**Last Updated**: July 7, 2026 (Session 65 — **SLA/REPORTING OVERHAUL SLICE 3: DIAGNOSTIC METRICS** — released **v0.4.37-6-gc917520**, all 3 boxes, staging-first (PR #10, CI green; mb-test verified on-box: full suite 0 failures, `/reports/` 302 → prod `update.sh` backup→B2, no migration, healthy → MB2 healthy), suite 263→**269**, no migration (reporting-only, no model change). Slice 3 of the 4-slice SLA/reporting overhaul (memory `project_mb_sla_reporting_overhaul`; Slices 1+2 shipped sessions 63–64). Reports page (`ReportsView`/`ReportsCSVView`) gains four additions: **median first-response time** next to the SLA % (`_median()` helper via `statistics.median` — median not mean, so one disaster ticket doesn't define it); **SLA % + median response time broken down by tech and by client** (`_sla_breakdown_by()` shared helper drives both groupings from one code path; help-topic breakdown deliberately deferred — help topic still has no bearing on the SLA itself, per the Slice 2 design); a new **"Backlog Health"** section — open-ticket count + aging buckets (<1d/1–3/3–7/7d+) — deliberately a **live snapshot NOT filtered by the reports date range** ("what's on the plate right now," forward-looking not historical; locked by a regression test that sets the date range to 2020 and confirms the backlog numbers don't move); and **created-vs-closed counts** for the selected period (`closed_in_period` reuses the existing `updated_at`-as-closed-timestamp proxy the resolution-time calc already relied on). CSV export added for two new report keys (`backlog`, `sla_breakdown`), matching the existing per-section CSV/print/PDF dropdown pattern — new dropdown entries added to all three menus, plus a `SECTION_LABELS` JS entry for `backlog`. 6 new tests. **NEXT: Slice 4** — reply-to-closed flag-don't-reopen (the careful lifecycle/inbound one), the last slice of the overhaul. **Still open from Slice 2:** the two SLA defaults (Settings → SLA Plans) are unset out of the box — Mike needs to pick them to activate auto-clocking.) // July 7, 2026 (Session 64 — **SLA/REPORTING OVERHAUL SLICE 2: CLIENT-TYPE DEFAULT SLA** — released **v0.4.37-3-g2a48b24**, all 3 boxes, staging-first (PR #9, CI green; mb-test verified on-box: full suite 0 failures, `/reports/` + `/settings/` 302 → prod `update.sh` backup→B2 + mig 0078, healthy → MB2 healthy), suite 254→**263**. Slice 2 of the 4-slice SLA/reporting overhaul (memory `project_mb_sla_reporting_overhaul`; Slice 1 shipped session 63). **Every new ticket now gets a response clock at creation, driven solely by `Client.client_type`** (business/residential) — Mike: "the SLA is determined solely by client type; help topic has no say." Two new `SiteSettings` fields, `default_business_sla`/`default_residential_sla` (nullable FK→SLAPlan), editable in a new **Settings → SLA Plans** card (`SLADefaultsForm`/`SLADefaultsUpdateView`, mirrors the existing `EmailBrandingForm` pattern); blank = that client type stays clock-less exactly as before. **`Ticket.assign_default_sla_for_client()`** fires inside `Ticket.save()` only when adding and no `sla_plan` is already set (an explicit form pick always wins) — covers every creation path (ticket form, inbound email, T2) for free since they all route through `Ticket.save()`. **Refined mid-session (Mike): "since only clients can create tickets, setting the client type sets the SLA; Unsorted inherit SLA from selected client at triage."** The Unsorted/Unverified system client is residential-typed, so it gets the residential default as a **placeholder** clock (same rule, no special-casing) — then **re-snapshots** to the real client's type-default the moment it's triaged off the bucket in `TicketUpdateView.form_valid()`, unless that same edit *also* hand-picked an SLA plan (which always wins); an ordinary real-client-to-real-client reassignment never moves the SLA. **Real bug caught mid-build:** the first triage-detection attempt read `self.object.client.is_unsorted` inside `form_valid()` — but by then Django's `form.is_valid()` → `_post_clean()` had already mutated `self.object.client` in memory to the *new* client (before the DB write), so it was silently checking the wrong client and the resnapshot condition was always false. Fixed by re-querying the DB directly for the pre-save row (`Ticket.objects.filter(pk=...).values_list('client_id', 'client__is_unsorted')`), caught by the triage regression test rather than shipped broken. **Forward-only, no backfill** (Mike's call, matching the Slice-1 precedent) — existing clock-less tickets aren't retroactively stamped, avoiding an overnight flip to "overdue" for old open tickets. Migration 0078. 9 new tests. **One action for Mike:** the two SLA defaults are unset out of the box — set them in Settings → SLA Plans to activate. **NEXT: Slice 3 — diagnostic metrics** (median first-response time, backlog aging buckets, created-vs-closed, tech/client breakdowns).) // July 6, 2026 (Session 63 — **REPORTS: SLA COMPLIANCE = FIRST RESPONSE, NOT CLOSURE** — released **v0.4.37**, all 3 boxes, staging-first (PR #8, CI green; mb-test verified on-box: 13 SLA/report tests + `/reports/` 302 → prod `update.sh` backup→B2 + rollback point, no migration, healthy → MB2 healthy), suite +1 test, no migration. Mike, reviewing the Reports page, flagged that report 6 "SLA Compliance Rate" measured whether a ticket was *closed* before its due date — wrong. MB's ticket SLA is a **response** SLA (session 42: `Ticket.first_responded_at` stamped on the first staff customer-visible reply; `is_overdue`/`overdue_queryset` already stop the clock at first response; `due_at = created_at + grace_period`); the *report* was the only place still using closure (report 5 already covers resolution/closure time separately). Fixed the on-screen calc (`ReportsView`) **and** the CSV export (`ReportsCSVView`) to count `first_responded_at <= due_at`; labels updated ("First response before SLA due date"), context var `closed_on_time`→`responded_on_time`. **Set-aside denominator (Mike's call):** a ticket is only *judged* once its outcome is decided — answered, or its deadline already passed (`Q(first_responded_at__isnull=False) | Q(due_at__lt=now)`); a still-in-window unanswered ticket is excluded (`pending_sla`), NOT a miss. Rate = answered-on-time ÷ judged; template guards the all-pending case; regression test `test_sla_compliance_report_first_response_and_sets_aside_pending`. **Slice 1 of a 4-slice SLA/reporting overhaul** (memory `project_mb_sla_reporting_overhaul`): Slice 2 = every ticket gets a response clock at creation via a **client-type default SLA** (business/residential — Mike: the SLA is driven by *who the client is*, help topic has no say; every ticket has a client so there's no no-client path — the system "Unsorted" client rides the residential default until triaged); Slice 3 = diagnostic metrics (median first-response time next to the %, backlog open-count + aging buckets <1d/1–3/3–7/7d+, created-vs-closed, breakdowns by tech/client); Slice 4 = **reply-to-a-closed-ticket flag-don't-reopen** — today MB auto-reopens a closed ticket on ANY client reply (session 29), so a "thanks" or a client re-engaging after Mike closes a stale unanswered ticket = busywork + pollutes reopen-rate; fix = thread+flag but STAY closed, Mike Reopens/Dismisses one-click (extends the converted-ticket `needs_response` pattern), ~14-day reopen window (older reply → new linked ticket), then reopen-rate returns as a genuine signal. Prior tag v0.4.36 already existed (not captured in this log). NEXT: Slice 2.) // July 3, 2026 (Session 62 — **WORKORDER DESIGN-PASS WALKTHROUGH + SITE-WIDE HEADER CONSISTENCY** — released **v0.4.32 through v0.4.35**, all 3 boxes, staging-first, CI green throughout, suite stayed **237** (no new model/behavior, template+view only). WorkOrder was the first record type walked under the design criteria since the pass paused after Estimate (session 59). **v0.4.32** — the Work Performed `+Custom` entry form was missing the reset-on-success fix Sale/Estimate got in earlier rounds (`hx-on:htmx:after-request` only closed the panel, never called `this.reset()` — same recurring defect, different record type each time it's found). **v0.4.33** — New Device and New Work Order create pages had no back-link to the client they were opened from (`DeviceCreateView`/`WorkOrderCreateView` now resolve `back_client` from `?client=` and render the same "← Client Name" header link every detail page already used); a walk-in (clientless) WO had **zero** navigation back to anything at all — its toolbar's only nav link was `{% if work_order.client %}`-gated, a real dead end, not just a cosmetic gap — fixed with a "← Work Orders" fallback. **Bigger finding, surfaced when Mike compared 5 header screenshots side by side:** WorkOrder detail was the *one* true header-chrome outlier, not a site-wide problem as first assumed — every other detail/list page already shared one `page-title-bar` shell (breadcrumb → title → badges → right-aligned actions); WO alone carried a second, hardcoded-black (`bg-gray-900`, bypassing the site's configurable `--color-title-bar`) toolbar of plain-text action links stacked above its own title bar. **v0.4.34** — WO's toolbar collapsed into the same shell as every other page: its ~7 action links became an Alpine "Actions" dropdown, the quick-status `<select>` moved into the header proper. Also added a **shared notification bell** (`core/partials/header_bell.html`, reuses `NotificationCountView` with a new `?style=header` badge variant alongside the existing sidebar one) to the Dashboard and every primary detail page header. **v0.4.35** — same bell extended to all 10 list pages (Tickets/WorkOrders/Clients/Estimates/Sales/Prospects/Devices/Mileage/KB/Queues) after Mike flagged the first round only covered WO. **Fourth design criterion extracted:** one canonical page-header shape — breadcrumb, title, badge row, right-aligned actions — action *count* can vary per page (dropdown vs. inline buttons) but the shell and the bell's position within it should not. **Deferred, not forgotten (Mike: "note it and we'll revisit it"):** whether list-page search/filter rows should also collapse — Mike agrees hiding the search box itself would hurt the core workflow, but still finds the full row (search + 2-3 filter dropdowns + Search/Clear + bell + New) visually cluttered; the concrete direction to pick up later is a "Filters" toggle collapsing the secondary status/technician dropdowns while search+bell+New stay always visible. See memory `project_mb_design_criteria_pass` for the full write-up.) // July 2, 2026 (Session 61 — **WORKORDER + DEVICE GO CLIENT-LESS (WALK-IN SUPPORT)** — released **v0.4.31**, all 3 boxes, staging-first, CI green, suite 225→**237**. Mike, testing the New Work Order page: could select a walk-in customer but not a new device — and asked the deeper question: "the walk-in customer isn't a real customer, but a placeholder... purchases and work orders will grow exponentially under them. Is there a good way to handle such a placeholder?" Confirmed via research: `WorkOrder.client` was a required FK (no walk-in concept in WorkOrder at all, unlike `Sale.client` which is already nullable) and `Device.client` was required too — every anonymous repair was piling onto one ordinary shared `Client` row forever. Mike's own framing decided the design: *"Is it possible to null the customer, but track device information? It might be useful to track device types, makes/models... to see trends and failure types."* **Migration 0075** — `WorkOrder.client` and `Device.client` both went nullable (`SET_NULL`, matching Sale's existing pattern). A walk-in WO/device is now a real, permanent row (full manufacturer/model/type/repair history intact for future trend reporting) with simply no owning Client — nothing ever accumulates on a placeholder. Every `client.name`/`{% url %}` reference to `work_order.client`/`device.client` across the app (WO detail toolbar+card, device detail, device/WO lists, dashboard, sidebar, repair report, email report, mileage) was audited and guarded — several were genuine crash risks (`{% url %}` with a None pk raises `NoReverseMatch`), not just cosmetic; shows "Walk-in (anonymous)" consistent with Sale's existing display. **Two real pre-existing bugs fixed along the way, unrelated to nullability:** the New Work Order device dropdown was never scoped to the selected client (showed every device for every client in one flat list — `WorkOrderForm` never had the `Device.objects.filter(client_id=...)` line `EstimateForm`/`TicketForm` already had); wired the existing `TicketContactsByClientView` HTMX cascade endpoint (built for Ticket, generic enough to reuse as-is) so the device list narrows live on client change. New Work Order also gained an inline **"New Device" quick-add card** (reusing `DeviceQuickAddForm` from the New-Client-page pattern, session 59) so a tech never has to leave the page to log a walk-in device — `WorkOrderCreateView.post()` creates it transactionally, attached to whichever client is selected or left as a walk-in device if none. **Fallout fixed:** `reset_operational_data` relied on `Client` cascading to delete `WorkOrder`/`Device` — with `SET_NULL` they'd otherwise survive orphaned, so both are now deleted explicitly before `Client`; `push_work_order()` now routes a walk-in WO to Invoice Ninja's standing "Walk-In" client (`find_or_create_walkin_client()`, already built for Sale's counter lane) instead of crashing on a None client. 12 new tests (walk-in WO/device creation with and without a client, new-device attaches to the right owner, device-dropdown-scoping regression, WO/device detail render clean with a None client, `reset_operational_data` actually deletes walk-in rows). **NEXT candidate for the design-criteria pass:** WorkOrder itself hasn't been walked yet under the same one-page/field-justification criteria Sale and Estimate got.) // July 2, 2026 (Session 60 — **STATIC-ASSET CACHE-BUSTING** — released **v0.4.30**, all 3 boxes, staging-first, CI green, no migration. Closes the gap flagged at the end of session 59 (the invisible `+Add Option` button traced to a stale-cached `app.css` — MB's static URLs never changed between deploys). Production (`DEBUG=False`) now uses `django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.ManifestStaticFilesStorage`: `collectstatic` content-hashes every static file (`app.css`→`app.0ce8cf94fccd.css`) and rewrites every `{% static %}` reference, so a style-only deploy always busts the browser cache — `update.sh` already runs `collectstatic` on every deploy, no new step. **Deliberately gated on `DEBUG`** — local dev keeps the old unhashed backend, because `manage.py runserver` never runs `collectstatic` and Manifest's strict hashed-name lookup would 500 on `{% static %}` for anyone who hasn't run it by hand (this would've broken the documented "Development Setup" flow for a normal `runserver` session). **Two real broken-static-ref bugs the switch immediately surfaced and fixed:** vendored `chart-4.4.0.umd.min.js` and `html2pdf-0.10.1.bundle.min.js` both carried a dangling `//# sourceMappingURL=...` comment pointing at a `.map` file that was never vendored — Manifest's post-processing follows those references and fails loud (collectstatic literally would not complete) on a missing file. Stripped the debug-only comments (sourcemaps aren't needed at runtime; this is exactly the kind of static-ref regression this backend exists to catch going forward). Verified via `collectstatic` under `DEBUG=False` locally (byte-identical to CI/prod), confirmed on mb-test the served CSS URL is actually hashed (`curl` + `ssh` cross-check), full suite green (229). See memory `project_mb_design_criteria_pass` session 59 entry for the bug this closes.) // July 2, 2026 (Session 59 — **LOGIN-LOGO VIEWPORT FIX SHIPPED + NEW-CLIENT INLINE DEVICE + ESTIMATE DESIGN PASS + ESTIMATE COMPARATIVE OPTIONS** — nine releases (v0.4.19→v0.4.29), all staging-first (mb-test→prod→MB2), CI green throughout, suite 208→**229**. (a) **v0.4.19 — the held-back login-logo fix finally shipped** (built session 58, sat stashed): `max-height:min(560px, 32vh)` so the sign-in card no longer gets pushed off-screen on short viewports. (b) **v0.4.20 — New Client page gets an inline Device card** (Mike: techs shouldn't have to leave the page to log a client's first device): `DeviceQuickAddForm` (prefixed `device-` to avoid colliding with `ClientForm`'s own `name` field in the same `<form>`) renders an optional Device card on `client_form.html`; leaving Name blank skips device creation, both save in one `transaction.atomic()`. (c) **v0.4.21 — fixed inconsistent blue back links** on Estimate/Prospect/Sale detail pages (`text-blue-600 hover:underline` → the gray `text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600` every other detail page uses). (d) **v0.4.22 — Estimate create+edit collapsed into one page**, mirroring the Sale Round 1 rebuild: `EstimateCreateView` drops its GET form (one-click POST → blank unanchored draft → `estimate_detail`); Client/Prospect/Ticket/Contact/Device/Scope/Expires-On all live in a new `estimate_details_card.html` that auto-saves per field via `EstimateQuickUpdateView` (selects on change, Scope on blur); Client/Prospect mutual exclusivity now enforced procedurally (picking one clears the other) instead of via a form validation error, since an auto-save flow has nowhere good to show one. Removed `EstimateUpdateView`, `estimate_form.html`, the `estimate_edit` URL entirely. (e) **v0.4.23 — Estimate comparative pricing options** (Mike: quoted a device replacement with 3 vendor options for a client and had to make 3 separate estimates — "clients often like comparative options"). Locked design (Mike): rejected options stay on record (nothing deleted when a client picks one); each option totals independently (no shared/delta pricing); Accept still makes one WorkOrder, now requiring a selection when options exist and carrying only that option's lines. New **`EstimateOption`** model (migration 0073) — reuses the existing `LineItem` GenericForeignKey machinery as a **fourth host type** alongside WorkOrder/Estimate/Sale (`EstimateOption.line_items = GenericRelation('LineItem')`), so every add/edit/delete/print code path is shared, not duplicated; `EstimateOption.select()` clears sibling `is_selected`. Estimate detail gets "+ Add Option"; each option renders as its own card with its own entry form and subtotal; quote PDF/print renders each option as its own priced block. (f) **v0.4.24 — two bugs found live by Mike testing (e).** The pre-existing "General" `+Custom` form was missing `this.reset()` (Sale got this fix session 58, Estimate's flat form never did — fields kept stale values after logging); and a brand-new unanchored draft (side effect of (d)) 500'd `EstimateQuotePrintView`/`EstimateQuoteEmailView` (`AttributeError` on a `None` prospect) — both views now redirect with a message instead. (g) **v0.4.25 — the actual "options combined in total" bug** (Mike's exact report, reproduced via real UI clicks not raw requests): the General section's subtotal was **hidden entirely** once any option existed (`{% if not options %}` wrapped the whole block instead of just relabeling it Total→Subtotal) — so a General item sat with no visible total on both the detail page and the printed quote, next to options that each showed their own. Now General always renders its own Subtotal/Total line. (h) **v0.4.26 — General gets its own "+Item" control**, matching every option card (previously only the top-toolbar `+Custom`/`+Log Item` could add to General — inconsistent once options existed). (i) **v0.4.27/v0.4.28 — General section becomes renamable** (Mike: "General" didn't read like a real option name next to "All Cisco"/"TP-Link"). New `Estimate.general_label` field (migration 0074, default `'General'`), auto-saves on blur via `EstimateGeneralLabelUpdateView`; v0.4.28 same-session hotfix — the input was styled invisible-border-until-hover so it looked non-editable next to the (genuinely non-editable) option names; switched to the same bordered-input style used everywhere else in MB. (j) **v0.4.29 — quote print cleanup** (Mike, comparing the detail page to the printed quote side by side): dropped the "Option: " prefix that only appeared on option blocks in print (General had none — inconsistent with the detail page, where nothing is prefixed) and suppressed the "Other" category sub-heading that showed above every custom-logged item with no `QuickLaborItem` source (the common case) — pure noise, real categories from an actual Quick Labor button still show. **Debugging note:** the mid-session "invisible +Add Option button" turned out to be a stale-cached `app.css` in Mike's browser (unversioned static URL, confirmed by hard-refresh) — flagged but not yet fixed; **NEXT candidate: cache-busting for static assets** (e.g. `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`) so a future style-only deploy can't leave a UI element looking broken until someone thinks to hard-refresh. See memory `project_mb_design_criteria_pass` for the running design-pass log — Estimate's walkthrough is now further along than Sale's was at the equivalent point (four extra rounds of live bug-hunting via real UI reproduction, not just design opinion).) // July 2, 2026 (Session 58 — **DESIGN/UX CRITERIA PASS BEGINS — SALE DETAIL PAGE, 3 ROUNDS (v0.4.16, v0.4.17, v0.4.18, all 3 boxes)**. First real session against the long-deferred design-criteria walkthrough (memory `project_mb_design_criteria_pass`, raised and dropped once before — see `feedback_track_design_commitments_durably`). Mike reacted to the live Sale detail page across three follow-on rounds, each staging-first (mb-test → Mike-reviewed → prod/MB2), each its own PR + CI green. **Round 1 (v0.4.16, PR #5) — collapse create+edit into one page.** Mike: *"Edit and the initial sale process should be the same. Both should be a single page, not two."* `SaleCreateView` dropped its GET form entirely — "New Sale" is now a one-click POST that creates a blank draft and redirects straight to `sale_detail`. Customer/Contact/Notes became an inline-editable card on the detail page itself, reusing the existing WorkOrder Details-card Alpine edit-toggle pattern (no new UI idiom). A brand-new blank sale opens straight into edit mode — zero extra clicks. Removed `sales/<pk>/edit/` + `sale_form.html` entirely. Also fixed in passing: the checkout amount field's server-computed prefill could carry >2 decimal places (0.5hrs×$60=$30.000), failing its own step=0.01 validation on an unedited submit — quantized to cents. **Round 1.5 (v0.4.17, PR #6) — two bugs Mike found testing round 1 on mb-test.** (a) The Checkout card lived outside `#sale-line-items-section` (the HTMX swap target for line-item add/edit/delete), so it stayed stuck on "add a priced line first" even after logging one — fixed via an out-of-band HTMX swap of `#sale-checkout-card` whenever a line item changes (`_sale_checkout_context()` factored out, shared by initial render + OOB refresh). (b) The custom line-item entry form didn't clear after logging (Alpine only hid the panel) — fixed with the `if(event.detail.successful){this.reset(); ...}` pattern already used by the WorkOrder note form elsewhere in the codebase. **Round 2 (v0.4.18, PR #7) — no Save button, Contact removed entirely.** Mike, looking at the Customer card: *"why is there a Save button?"* → *"Selecting an existing client or a walk-in client should be all that's required."* Rebuilt again: no Edit/Cancel toggle at all now — Client auto-saves on `change`, Notes auto-saves on `blur`, baked as `hx-*` attrs directly into `SaleForm`'s widgets (its only consumer). Then Mike challenged Contact directly: *"explain why I should collect that information from a counter sale."* Honest answer: it only existed because Sale's fields were copied from WorkOrder/Estimate's pattern. Mike's ruling: *"a receipt with the client's name, the item, amount, and paid should cover it. Anything else should be a purchase order or attached to a work order."* **Removed the model field entirely** (migration 0072, `RemoveField` — not just hidden in the UI), including its two receipt-default-contact fallbacks in `_receipt_context`/`SaleReceiptEmailView` and all three `select_related('client', 'contact')` call sites. **Correctness catch along the way:** since Client and Notes now submit independently (different `hx-trigger` each), binding the whole `SaleForm` to a partial POST would silently blank whichever field wasn't included in that request — `SaleQuickUpdateView` now updates only the field actually present in `request.POST`, mirroring `WorkOrderQuickUpdateView`'s manual-field style rather than `ModelForm.save()`. **Also fixed same session (found live on prod via Mike's own screenshot, shipped as its own hotfix v0.4.15, PR #4):** a multi-line `{# #}` Django comment (the tag is single-line only) in `sale_checkout_card.html` was rendering as literal visible text on every completed/draft Sale detail page in production — switched to `{% comment %}...{% endcomment %}`, regression test added. **Three design criteria extracted so far** (memory `project_mb_design_criteria_pass` has the full write-up): (1) size UI elements against the real viewport, not fixed pixels (from the login-logo bug, fix built but deliberately held back — batch with next round, not yet deployed); (2) one page/form for create+edit of the same record, no separate save step beyond what's truly needed; (3) don't collect a field on a record just because a sibling record type has it — justify each field against what *that specific* record needs. Suite 201→208 across the session. **NEXT:** Estimate detail page walkthrough (same questions likely apply — consolidation + field justification); the held-back login-logo viewport fix; eventually a written-up first-pass criteria doc. See memory `project_mb_design_criteria_pass` for the full blow-by-blow.) // July 1, 2026 (Session 57 — **FINANCIAL+SALES LAYER, SLICE 3c: SALE RECEIPT PDF/EMAIL — COUNTER LANE COMPLETE** — released **v0.4.14**, all 3 boxes, staging-first (PR #3, CI green; mb-test 201/201 on-box, 0 skipped → prod → MB2), suite 195→**201**, no migration. Closes the counter lane. **`sale_receipt_print.html`** — same browser-preview/PDF template trick as the quote and repair report (`@media print` hides on-screen controls, shows the footer); adapted from `estimate_quote_print.html`: "Sold To" instead of "Quote For", a **Payment** section (method/amount paid/reference) instead of Scope, a "Thank you for your business" line instead of a signature block (nothing to sign — it's already paid). **`_receipt_context(sale, site)`** mirrors `_quote_report_context()`; an anonymous walk-in renders as a bare "Walk-in" Sold-To (no address/contact fields). **`SaleReceiptPrintView`** + **`SaleReceiptEmailView`**, both `SaleAccessMixin`-gated and additionally **gated on `sale.status == 'completed'`** (redirects with an error otherwise — no receipt before payment). The email recipient form (`sale_email_receipt.html`) mirrors the quote's: a client's contacts populate a dropdown with a custom-address override; **an anonymous walk-in sale has no default address at all** (unlike a Prospect, which at least has an inline email) so it always requires typing one in. `trigger='sale_receipt'`; filename `Receipt-{sale_number}.pdf`. "Print Receipt" / "Email Receipt" links added to the completed-state payment card (`sale_checkout_card.html`, from Slice 3b). 6 tests (print renders w/ total, print/email blocked pre-completion via redirect, client-anchored contact send, walk-in custom-address send, missing-address guard) — 2 pdf-gated (mb-test confirmed 0 skipped, so the PDF-dependent ones actually ran, not just print-view smoke tests). **🎉 Counter lane (Lane B) COMPLETE** — `Sale` → checkout (paid, pushed to IN under the client or a standing "Walk-In" client) → receipt PDF/email, fully shipped across Slices 3a/3b/3c. **NEXT:** the IN payment `type_id` mapping (left unmapped in 3b) is deferred until Mike sets up his IN/Square integration — his explicit call, not a build gap; after that the next open lane is **Lane C** (ServiceAgreement / recurring, Slice 5) — the Option C (tokenized card-on-file, manual-trigger charge via IN's `tokenBilling()`) design is already locked, see memory `project_mb_card_payment_security`. See memory `project_mb_financial_module_design` (Slice 3c entry).) // July 1, 2026 (Session 56 — **FINANCIAL+SALES LAYER, SLICE 3b: SALE CHECKOUT + SEND-TO-IN** — released **v0.4.13**, all 3 boxes, staging-first (PR #2, CI green; mb-test 195/195 on-box → prod backup→B2 + mig 0071 → MB2), suite 186→**195**. Closes the counter lane's payment loop. **`SaleCheckoutForm`** (payment_method required; `amount` **editable, pre-filled from the server-computed `line_items_total`** — the un-tamperable-amount rigor was card-charging-specific and doesn't apply to a hand-recorded counter sale; reference optional). **`SaleCheckoutView`** = **bundled one-click "Complete Sale"**: one `transaction.atomic()` records the payment + sets `status='completed'`, THEN (if IN enabled) pushes a **PAID** invoice via `invoice_ninja.push_sale()`. **Push failure never rolls back the recorded payment** (fail loud, keep the cash record) → a "Retry Send to Invoice Ninja" button appears; **`SaleSendINView`** is the retry/re-send path (WO-style duplicate guard via `confirm_resend`). **`push_sale()`** generalizes `_line_items_payload(work_order)`→`_line_items_payload(host)` (WO + Sale share the `line_items` GenericRelation), POSTs `/invoices` THEN `/payments` (for the recorded amount) so IN shows **Paid**, not Draft, and stores `invoice_ninja_id`/`invoice_ninja_ref`/`in_status='Paid'`. **DECISION REVERSED this session (Mike):** anonymous walk-in sales ARE now pushed to IN under a standing generic **"Walk-In" client** (`find_or_create_walkin_client()`, link-once cached in `SiteSettings.invoice_ninja_walkin_client_id`) — NOT MB-record-only as Slice 3a's design said. Every sale hits IN when enabled → IN stays a complete ledger, one consistent checkout path. **Migration 0071** (`Sale.invoice_ninja_ref` + the walk-in cache field). New `sale_checkout_card.html` partial wired into `sale_detail` (draft → checkout form; completed → recorded payment + IN status + retry/re-send). 10 tests. **Build-time follow-up (NOT blocking, deferred):** the IN payment `type_id` per method (cash/check/card) is left **UNMAPPED/omitted** for safety until confirmed against Mike's live IN (a wrong id 400s `/payments`; the payment still marks the invoice Paid without it, and the method is captured in the payment's `private_notes`) — `_IN_PAYMENT_TYPE_IDS = {}` in `core/invoice_ninja.py`, populate after verifying. **NEXT: Slice 3c — receipt PDF/email** (reuse the Slice 2b WeasyPrint + `send_document_email` foundation, trigger='sale_receipt'). See memory `project_mb_financial_module_design` (Slice 3b entry) + `project_mb_card_payment_security` (anonymous-sale reversal note).) // June 30, 2026 (Session 55 — **FINANCIAL+SALES LAYER, SLICE 3a: SALE MODEL (Counter lane)** — released **v0.4.12**, all 3 boxes, staging-first, suite 174→**186**. First build slice of Slice 3 (Counter lane) design locked earlier this session after an extended payment-processing deep-dive with Mike (memory `project_mb_card_payment_security` — card-not-present recurring is the real revenue lane, MB will never process payments itself, IN is the billing backend behind a swappable seam). **`Sale` model** (migration 0070): a counter/walk-in sale, `client` **nullable** (an anonymous cash sale stays MB-only — Invoice Ninja needs a client, so it's never pushed), optional `contact`, `SALE-NNNNN` sequential numbering (mirrors WO/Estimate), simple CharField status (draft/completed/void), reuses the `LineItem` GenericRelation as a **third host** alongside WorkOrder/Estimate — zero new edit/delete code, rides the exact `_render_line_items`/`WorkPerformedUpdateView`/`WorkPerformedDeleteView` path. Payment/checkout fields (`payment_method`, `amount`, `paid_at`, `reference`) + the IN-tracking trio (`invoice_ninja_id`/`in_status`/`in_status_checked_at`) are defined now but **inert until Slice 3b** — same pattern Estimate used for its 2c fields in 2a. `can_view_sales` Role flag (default True) mirrors `can_view_prospects`/`can_view_estimates` exactly; new `cash` icon. **Also fixed in passing:** `can_view_estimates` had been missing from the Settings → Roles permission-grid display (`_ROLE_FLAGS`) since Slice 2a — present in the form, invisible in the UI. Added both flags to the grid. 12 tests, suite 174→**186**; full create→line-item→edit→role-block→delete walkthrough verified end-to-end via the real view/template stack (the Preview MCP tool wasn't reaching the dev server correctly this session — an environment wiring issue, not an app bug — so verification used Django's test client against the actual URLs/templates instead). **NEXT: Slice 3b — checkout + Send-to-IN** (record payment method/amount/reference; generalize the WO→IN push so a Sale creates a paid invoice in IN — mirroring Mike's current manual Square→IN entry, not auto-charging anything), **then Slice 3c — receipt PDF/email** (reuse the Slice 2b WeasyPrint + `send_document_email` foundation). See memory `project_mb_financial_module_design` for the Slice 3 design lock and `project_mb_card_payment_security` for the full payment-architecture decision record.) // June 30, 2026 (Session 54 — **FINANCIAL+SALES LAYER, SLICE 1+2 COMPLETE (IN status check-back; full Estimate/quote lifecycle)** — four releases, all staging-first (mb-test→prod→MB2), CI green throughout, suite 151→**174**. (a) **v0.4.7/v0.4.8 — Slice 1: payment visibility.** Added `invoice_ninja_id`/`in_status`/`in_status_checked_at` to `Invoice` (mig 0067); `check_invoice_status(work_order)` in `core/invoice_ninja.py` GETs `/invoices/{id}` and maps IN's numeric `status_id` to a label (Draft/Sent/Partial/Paid/Cancelled/Reversed/Overdue), recording it on the Invoice row — closes the Jun 27 IN→MB "is it paid?" gap that drove the double-entry incident. `WorkOrderBillingCheckINView` ("Check IN" button on the billing card) triggers the read and re-renders; deliberately does **not** auto-update `billing_status` (record only — Mike’s call, can change later). v0.4.8 fixed a status_id int-coercion bug (IN returns it as a string; "Unknown (1)" → "Draft"). Narrowed vs the original holistic design (no Invoice→Transaction rename/GenericFK — premature until Lane B/C exist). (b) **v0.4.9 — Slice 2a: Estimate model + CRUD + line items** (mig 0068). Split Slice 2 into 2a/2b/2c (too large for one push). `Estimate` anchors to exactly one of Client/Prospect (`clean()` enforced), optional ticket/contact/device, `EST-NNNNN` sequential numbering (mirrors WorkOrder), simple CharField status (draft/sent/accepted/declined/expired), reuses the `LineItem` GenericRelation + `line_items_total`. 2c’s fields (`decline_reason`, `revision_of`, `accepted_at`, `work_order`) defined now, inert until 2c. `can_view_estimates` Role flag (default True) mirrors `can_view_prospects` exactly. Line-item editing reuses the WO Work Performed UI (Quick Labor buttons + custom entry); refactored `_render_work_performed`→host-aware `_render_line_items` so WO and Estimate share one edit/delete code path — zero WO regression (full suite stayed green through the refactor). (c) **v0.4.10 — Slice 2b: quote PDF + sales email** (mig 0069). `SiteSettings.email_sales_from` (dedicated From/Reply-To for quotes, blank falls back to the support address). `_quote_report_context()` builds a unified bill-to block for either anchor (Client w/ contact, or a Prospect's inline email/phone — no Contact rows exist for a prospect). `estimate_quote_print.html` reuses the WeasyPrint `@media print` trick from the repair report (one template = browser preview + PDF). `EstimateQuotePrintView` + `EstimateQuoteEmailView` (recipient form → render_pdf → send_document_email, trigger='estimate_quote'). **Decisions (Mike):** emailing the quote auto-advances draft→sent (emailing IS sending; re-send never reverts sent/accepted); reuses the default EmailSignature for now (no dedicated sales signature yet). mb-test ran the suite with 0 skipped, confirming WeasyPrint libs are live on-box, not just CI. (d) **v0.4.11 — Slice 2c: accept→WO / decline / revise** (code-only, **no migration** — all fields existed from 2a). `EstimateAcceptView` (draft/sent only, one `transaction.atomic()`): promotes a prospect-anchored estimate via the existing `Prospect.promote_to_client()` then **re-anchors** the estimate to the new Client (prospect cleared, keeping the single-anchor invariant); creates a WorkOrder (`reported_problem=scope`); **OneToOne ticket guard** — links to `estimate.ticket` only if that ticket has no WO yet, else creates a standalone WO with a note in the success message (avoids an IntegrityError on the WO.ticket OneToOne); copies LineItems snapshotted onto the WO; sets `status='accepted'`/`accepted_at`/`work_order`. `EstimateDeclineView` (draft/sent only) requires a non-empty `decline_reason`. **Key decision, reversing the original locked design: NO ticket close-gate on decline** — Mike’s call, consistent with the Jun 28 v0.4.2 removal of the WO-open close-block ("MB shouldn’t impose workflow opinions"); declining just records, the tech is trusted to follow up — this also removed the riskiest part of the original 2c scope (no ticket-path code touched at all). `EstimateReviseView` (sent/declined/expired only) creates a new linked draft `Estimate` (`revision_of`) with lines copied; `Estimate.is_locked` extended from `status=='accepted'` to also cover `revisions.exists()` so a revised estimate freezes read-only. **🎉 Slice 2 (Planned/Sales Lane) COMPLETE** — Prospect/Client → Estimate → quote PDF/email → accept→WO or decline, fully shipped, zero Invoice Ninja touch at quote time. See memory `project_mb_financial_module_design`. **NEXT: Slice 3 — Counter lane** (`Sale` entity + checkout + receipts, lock the Square-as-IN-gateway path).) // June 29, 2026 (Session 53 — **FINANCIAL+SALES LAYER, SLICE 0: PROSPECT (customer spine)** — released **v0.4.6**, all 3 boxes, staging-first, suite 140→**149**. First build slice of the holistic financial+sales design (memory `project_mb_financial_module_design`; supersedes the old Phase 2/3/4 numbering). **`Prospect` model (migration 0066)** — a thin sales lead captured **contact-first** (Mike's framing: the contact leads; a contact may be an individual or sit within a company): `contact_first_name`/`contact_last_name` (last optional), optional `company`, **`client_type` required at entry** (known before any quote), `email`/`phone`/`notes`, and a **5-stage pipeline** `status` (new/contacted/quoted/won/lost — deliberately NOT stripped to two; "we know what small shops need"). **`promote_to_client()`** is the spine slice: one `transaction.atomic()` that creates a `Client` (business→named for the company, residential→named for the person) **and always a primary `Contact`** (contact-first), sets `status='won'` + `promoted_to`/`promoted_at`; **idempotent** (already-promoted returns the existing client) and **collision-safe** (a duplicate Client name raises `IntegrityError` → surfaced as a message, NOT a 500; dedup/merge deferred to a later slice). **Does NOT touch Invoice Ninja** — IN client stays lazy-at-first-invoice. CRUD (`ProspectListView`/Detail/Create/Update + Promote/MarkLost/Delete) mirrors the `Client*` views; 3 templates (`prospect_list/form/detail.html`); list hides won/lost by default. **Visibility:** new **`can_view_prospects` Role flag, default `True`** (shown to everyone *unless* a role turns it off — "visible unless blocked by role"); wired into the sidebar nav (`user` icon, after Clients), the role-edit permission grid (`RoleForm` + the flag-tuple list), the context processor (`can_view_prospects` for the nav `{% if %}`), and a `ProspectAccessMixin` that 403s when blocked. 9 tests (create, business-requires-company, business+residential promotion, no-double-promote, no-delete-after-promote, role-block 403, mark-lost exclusion, GET-render). **Process:** built low-effort/Opus after the plan + 5 decisions were locked with Mike (expand stages; contact-first; client_type at entry; visible-unless-role-blocks; mark-lost+delete-before-promote). PR #1 → CI green → merged → tagged **v0.4.6** (Mike: "a way to go before reaching 5" — minor patch, not v0.5.0) → `update.sh` deployed prod (backup→B2, mig 0066, healthy) → MB2 (healthy); mb-test had 149 on-box, 0 skipped. **NEXT: Slice 1 — Payment visibility:** generalize `Invoice` (`core/models.py`) into the universal `Transaction` (GenericFK to WO/Sale/ServiceAgreement-cycle) + add a `check_invoice_status()` read path to `core/invoice_ninja.py` to close the IN→MB "is it paid?" loop (the Jun 27 double-entry driver). Models now **48** (mig 0066). Flagged for later (background task): bump CI's deprecated Node-20 GitHub Actions.) // June 28, 2026 (Session 52 — **FIVE SMALL RELEASES + POSTGRES DECOMMISSION + LAN SEGMENTATION AUDIT.** All staging-first (mb-test→prod→MB2), all green, suite 135→**140**. (a) **v0.4.2** — removed the hard block that prevented closing a ticket whose linked WO is still open (Jim challenged it; Mike agreed MB shouldn't bake in a workflow *opinion* — sequencing ticket-close vs WO-completion is the shop's policy). Removed in both close paths (`TicketUpdateView.form_valid` + `TicketStatusUpdateView`); no warning/flag (noise). The distinct *non-action* is kept: a completed WO still never auto-closes its ticket (`AUTO_RESOLVE_TICKET_ON_WO_CLOSE` off). (b) **v0.4.3** — WO Activity notes now **newest-first by default** with a per-browser sticky toggle (localStorage `mb_wo_notes_order`, matching the dark-mode/font-size precedent — no DB migration); implemented via `flex-col-reverse` so the visual order flips without touching DOM order or the HTMX `beforeend` swap (new notes pop in at top automatically); `space-y-4`→`gap-4` (reverse-safe). Scoped to WO notes only. (c) **v0.4.4** — fixed `/roles/<id>/edit/` 500: `role_form.html` used the `getfield` filter but never `{% load mb_icons %}` (`{% load %}` is per-template, not inherited from base.html) → TemplateSyntaxError. One-line fix + the page's first test. (d) **v0.4.5** — **MB is now SQLite-only.** Verified (via what Django actually loads) that prod AND MB2 were already running SQLite — MB2's `.env` even had `DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql`, but settings.py checked the bare token `== 'postgresql'`, so the dotted value never matched and it silently fell back to SQLite (latent bug). Removed the unused Postgres `if/else` from settings.py + swept every "Postgres optional/supported" doc claim (README, INSTALL §5 dropped, `.env.example`, database-schema, deployment-tls, bookstack-03; TODO/assessment/publish-checklist marked done). **Ops:** Postgres service purged on **all 3 boxes** (MB2 + prod both verified: service gone, 0 packages, nothing on 5432, app active on SQLite; mb-test was already clean); dead `DB_*` lines stripped from each `.env` (backups kept). Memory `project_mb_postgres_decommission`. (e) **LAN segmentation audit** (no code — Mike walked the mini across LANs, Claude tested reachability): one-way trusted→untrusted verified GOOD (main LAN reaches all; VM/IoT segments can't reach main). **Two infra gaps flagged for the firewall console (NOT MB):** the VM LAN can reach the firewall's web admin (80/443) where the 25.x segment correctly blocks it; and the non-trusted segments aren't isolated from each other. Memory `project_scs_vm_lan_segmentation_gap`. Decisions this session (Mike): MB shouldn't impose workflow opinions (close sequencing); SQLite is the *only* supported DB (removing the dead branch is less sloppy than carrying an untested one); note ordering = per-browser localStorage not DB. **NEXT unchanged: Phase 2 (Prospect entity) → Phase 3 (Estimate) → Phase 4 (quote PDF email).**) // June 25, 2026 (Session 51 — **EMAIL REPAIR REPORTS AS PDF** (commit `c04ec49`; live on all 3 boxes). First slice of the sales/quoting **product layer** (plan: prospect→estimate→quote, design in memory `project_mb_inventory_estimate_design`), built as a reusable **document-email foundation** so quotes reuse it next. **`core/pdf_utils.py`** — `render_pdf()` via **WeasyPrint 69** (imported lazily so a missing system lib can't crash boot); a `url_fetcher` maps `/media`+`/static` to disk so the logo embeds offline on a LAN-only box (no public URL) and a referenced-but-missing asset degrades to a transparent pixel instead of failing the doc. **Key technique:** renders `work_order_print.html` straight to PDF using WeasyPrint's default `print` media type — the template's existing `@media print` CSS hides the on-screen Print/Close controls and shows the footer, so **one template serves both the browser print page and the PDF** (no divergent copy). **Base-url gotcha (solved):** a bare-path or `file://` base makes WeasyPrint read refs directly via pathlib and BYPASS the url_fetcher (so `/media/...` was read from filesystem root and crashed); fixed by resolving against a synthetic **non-file** base (`https://murphys-bench.local/`) so refs stay URL-space and route through the fetcher. **`core/email_utils.py`** — `send_document_email()` (short HTML cover + PDF attachment) honoring every suppression layer + `Contact.receives_email`, always logging `EmailSendLog` (ticket optional); suppression factored into a shared `_suppression_reason()` that `send_ticket_email` now uses too. **`WorkOrderReportEmailView`** + recipient form (pick a contact or custom address) + **"Email Report"** button on the WO toolbar (the slot specced since Batch 11, never built) + new `envelope` icon. **Deploy prereq:** WeasyPrint's pango/cairo libs (`libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0 fonts-dejavu-core`) added to `scripts/setup.sh`, INSTALL.md, and the **CI workflow** (so CI runs the PDF tests, not skips); `update.sh` does NOT install system pkgs → one-time `apt` per box (prod = Mike-run sudo since prod NOPASSWD is scoped to gunicorn restart only; macOS dev = `brew install pango`). 7 tests, suite 128→**135** (PDF-dependent tests skip gracefully if libs absent — but CI now has them). **DECISIONS this session (Mike):** documents are **PDF not HTML-only** (the "right way" for a customer doc — saveable/printable/professional); **approval is manual-record for v1** (tech clicks Accept/Decline/Revise; a customer-clickable tokenized link is deferred — it needs public exposure, reverses the no-portal roadmap call); **prospects are a separate thin entity** promoted to Client on accept. Deployed mb-test (135 on-box, 0 skipped)→prod(update.sh, healthy)→MB2; CI green. **NEXT: Phase 2 (Prospect entity) + Phase 3 (Estimate model/workflow), then Phase 4 (quote PDF email from a sales from-address).** Plan file `~/.claude/plans/adaptive-soaring-parrot.md`. // Session 50 — **MESSAGES-NOW-VISIBLE BUGFIX.** `core/templates/core/base.html` never rendered Django messages, so success/error feedback from every full-page POST→redirect flow was **invisible app-wide** — the queued messages only surfaced (stale) on the next page that rendered them, the logout page (this is why "Send to Invoice Ninja" gave no warning and a stack of old messages dumped onto logout). Fix: a **dismissible, dark-mode-aware inline messages banner** at the top of `<main>` in base.html, reusing the `bg-{green,red,yellow,blue}-50` classes base.html already dark-remaps (Alpine `x-data="{show:true}"` per-item `×` dismiss via the `x-mark` icon). Removed the now-redundant hand-rolled message blocks from `settings.html`/`user_form.html`/`user_list.html`/`role_list.html` (one source of truth). **Deliberately did NOT build HTMX out-of-band message plumbing** the original bug note floated: an audit found **zero** HTMX views add-and-rely-on messages (no `HX-Request` handling anywhere in `views.py`; all 49 `messages.*()` calls are immediately followed by a full-page `redirect`), so the oob path would be speculative dead weight against the prime directive. 2 regression tests — one reproduces Mike's exact Send-to-IN scenario (asserts the error renders on the followed redirect page), one a success flow (ticket close); suite **126→128**. The Invoice Ninja refusal itself was always correct (no priced line items = nothing to invoice) — the only bug was invisible feedback. ⚠ Laptop dev venv still reports **Django 4.2.30** vs the pulled requirements pinning 5.2 — needs `pip install -r requirements.txt` (tests pass on 4.2; behavior identical; separate from this fix). See memory `project_mb_messages_not_rendered`. // Session 49 — **CONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY** (released **v0.4.0**, commit `19cd022`; **enforcing on all three boxes**). The last front-end hardening step; feasible now that the front-end is fully self-hosted. **Key decision (deliberate, not an oversight):** `script-src` keeps `'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'` because Alpine.js evaluates 400+ template expressions via `new Function()` and there are inline `<script>` blocks + 57 inline event handlers. The strict alternatives (per-request nonces / Alpine's CSP build) were evaluated and **rejected** — large, regression-prone rewrites of working UI that would *still* leave `'unsafe-eval'`. The real hardening lives in the other directives: `default-src`/`connect-src 'self'` (an injected script can't exfiltrate cross-origin), `frame-ancestors 'none'` (clickjacking, stronger than X-Frame-Options), `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri`/`form-action 'self'`; `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` for 73 inline styles + dynamic color block. Implemented as a dependency-free **`core.middleware.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware`** driven by two settings: `CSP_POLICY` (directive string) + `CSP_REPORT_ONLY` (bool, **default True**). A **`/csp-report/`** endpoint (`core.views.csp_report`, csrf-exempt, unauthenticated, size-capped) logs violations at WARNING. **Rollout:** shipped report-only → Mike browser-walked the heavy Alpine/inline pages on **mb-test** (Settings=38 Alpine roots, WO/ticket detail, Reports, dark-mode) → **zero violations** → flipped to enforce (`CSP_REPORT_ONLY=False` in `.env`); same on **prod** (front-end byte-identical to mb-test) and **MB2** (also walked via the public Cloudflare URL — confirmed CF Access injects nothing). 5 tests, suite **121→126**. **Rollback is an `.env`-only flip** (`CSP_REPORT_ONLY=True` or empty `CSP_POLICY`) — no code change. Follow-up: if Alpine is ever dropped/migrated to its CSP build, tighten `script-src` then. See memory `project_mb_tailwind_cdn_security`. // Session 48 — **DJANGO 4.2 (EOL) → 5.2 LTS UPGRADE** (released **v0.3.0**, commit `b38527f`). Django 4.2 LTS reached end-of-life ~Apr 7 2026 — prod was running an **unpatched framework**; moved to **5.2 LTS** (security support to **Apr 2028**, runs on the existing Py3.12). This was the eval's top security item, ahead of CSP. **Turned out remarkably clean: a scan for every API Django 5.x removed (`force_text`, `NullBooleanField`, `index_together`, `url()`, `USE_L10N`, …) came back EMPTY** — modern codebase → a *dependency* upgrade, not a rewrite. A throwaway-venv spike proved the full suite passes on 5.2.15 with `DeprecationWarning`+`PendingDeprecationWarning` promoted to errors, and **every current dep resolves UNCHANGED** — incl. the two flagged risks: `django-encrypted-model-fields` 0.6.5 (the gating risk — underpins all field encryption) round-trips encrypted fields, and `django-two-factor-auth` 1.18.1 (MFA is enforced) is fine. **No dependency bumps. No data migrations.** Only one code change: `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` was removed in Django 5.1 → the s3 attachment branch moved to the **`STORAGES` dict** (restating the staticfiles backend, since `STORAGES` replaces the whole default); the local-storage path SCS prod uses is unaffected. Suite **119→121** (deprecations-as-errors green in 3 places: dev venv, spike, mb-test). Deployed staging-first: **mb-test (108)** → verified incl. a shell probe that **existing encrypted device creds decrypt under 5.2** against the prod-data copy; then **prod (82)** via `update.sh` (backup→B2, auto-rollback armed) — verified **prod's REAL encrypted secrets decrypt** (IN token + mailbox passwords, login 200); then **MB2 (35.223)**. All three on **Django 5.2.15**. CI green on `b38527f` before the tag (Mike confirmed via GitHub web — `gh` is laptop-only). See memory `project_mb_django_upgrade`. // Session 47 — IN-APP ADMIN UPDATE BUTTON (released **v0.2.0**, commit `5f2fbd6`). Closes the LAST rung of Mike's self-sufficiency bar: an admin can now update MB from **Settings → Updates** instead of SSHing in. Hard constraint — a web request can't restart its own gunicorn (`update.sh` ends in `sudo systemctl restart`) — so it runs **out-of-band**: the view drops an empty trigger file `logs/update-trigger`; a systemd **`.path` unit** (`deploy/murphys-bench-update.path`, `PathExists`) watches it and launches a **one-shot** (`deploy/murphys-bench-update.service` → `scripts/run_update.sh`) that runs the existing `update.sh` UNTOUCHED and writes `logs/update-status.json` for an HTMX-polled status fragment. **No new sudo** (app only writes a file; the one-shot reuses update.sh's already-NOPASSWD restart). New `core/update_ops.py` (read-only git inspect + trigger/status helpers), 3 admin-gated views (`UpdateStatus/Check/Trigger`), `core/templates/core/partials/update_status.html`, Updates tab in `SETTINGS_TABS`. Decisions (Mike): **"Update to latest" only** (no tag-picker) + **single confirm click** (justified by update.sh's auto-rollback). 8 tests, suite **112→120**. **VERIFIED on mb-test (201):** units installed (path unit active); happy-path drill → `succeeded` + app restarted out-of-band; force-fail drill (broken migration on a higher tag) → migrate failed → **auto-rolled back to the good version, healthy**, status `failed` with log tail. ALSO this session: (a) **dev Python alignment COMPLETE** — MacBook Air M5 built its own Py3.12.13 venv (mini was already done), suite green on both; the `gh` CLI is now installed+authed (HTTPS token) on the laptop so CI can be confirmed before tagging. (b) **`update.sh` branch-deploy bug FIXED** (commit `5f2fbd6`, in v0.2.0): `update.sh <branch>` was checking out the box's STALE LOCAL branch ref instead of `origin/<branch>` — it silently DOWNGRADED mb-test mid-session; tags/SHAs were always safe (absolute). (c) First release cut via `scripts/release.sh` with CI confirmed green (`gh run list`). **DEPLOYED v0.2.0 to ALL THREE boxes:** mb-test (units + both drills), MB2 demo (units + happy drill — full NOPASSWD), prod (code deployed + healthy). prod units INSTALLED + path unit active/enabled (Mike ran the password-gated `/etc` copy-paste block — prod NOPASSWD is scoped to only `systemctl restart/status murphys-bench`). **v0.2.0 fully live on all three boxes; self-sufficiency bar COMPLETE end-to-end.** See memory `project_mb_publish_ops_selfsufficiency`. // Session 42 — TICKET SLA BUGFIX. A ticket that had been replied to and parked in Waiting-on-Customer still flipped **red/overdue** once `due_at` passed, because `is_overdue` only checked the deadline, never whether we'd actually responded. MB tickets carry a *response* SLA (`due_at = created_at + grace_period`), so once the first staff reply goes out the clock should stop for good. Fix: added **`Ticket.first_responded_at`**, stamped on the first staff **customer-visible** reply only (internal notes and inbound client replies do NOT count); `is_overdue` returns `False` once it's set and the clock never re-arms. **Migration 0065** backfills existing tickets from their earliest qualifying staff reply so already-replied tickets clear on deploy. Commit `2235c53`; deployed and 0065 applied (verified `[X]`) on prod (82) / MB2 (35.223) / mb-test (108). Suite 104→**107**. // Session 41 — FRONT-END SELF-HOSTING + WO REPORTED-ISSUE. (a) **CDN fully removed — entire front-end now self-hosted.** Trigger: Privacy Badger blocking `unpkg` on Mike's laptop silently broke the app (Alpine+HTMX failed to load) — a real-world proof that loading core deps from third-party CDNs is wrong for a self-hosted product. Fix in two strokes: **HTMX 1.9.12 + Alpine 3.15.12 vendored/pinned** into `static/js/` (commit `e445fdd`; resolved the floating `alpinejs@3.x.x`), and **Tailwind moved off `cdn.tailwindcss.com` to a compiled self-hosted stylesheet** `static/css/app.css` via the **standalone Tailwind v3.4.19 CLI** (`scripts/build_css.sh` + `tailwind.config.js` + `tailwind/input.css`; NO Node; binary cached in gitignored `.tailwind/`; `app.css` gitignored & built-on-deploy — `update.sh` builds before collectstatic) (commit `63d9421`). Purge-correctness checked by rendering 17 pages and verifying every `class=` token exists in app.css — caught that `{% icon %}` builds size classes dynamically in Python → **safelisted `(w|h)-(3..16)`**. Verified on mb-test (Mike eyeballed) incl. the Linux build path, then deployed prod+MB2+mb-test, 0 CDN refs. Also fixed a sidebar bug found same day: nav was `overflow-hidden` with no scroll region → footer clipped below Reports on short laptop screens; now a `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` region. (b) **WorkOrder.reported_problem** free-text "Reported Issue / Work Requested" field (migration 0064): WOs had no free-text problem field — only the predefined `repair_type` dropdown — and ticket→WO conversion **silently dropped `ticket.description`**. Now a bench-editable freeform field (works on standalone WOs with no ticket), carried from the ticket on convert, shown on form/detail/repair-report. Suite 102→**104**. (c) **NEXT: CSP** — now feasible (no CDN) but non-trivial (Alpine needs `unsafe-eval` or a CSP-build rewrite; inline scripts need nonces; inline styles → `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`). Plan: **report-only first**, its own session. (d) **Open task logged:** align dev Mac Python 3.9→3.12 (no 3.12 installed; best done on the incoming MacBook Air) — memory `project_mb_dev_python_alignment`. See memories `project_mb_tailwind_cdn_security`, `project_mb_wo_reported_issue`, `feedback_dont_excuse_shortcuts_with_my_gaps`. // Session 40 — PUBLISH-READINESS + CI GATE + SELF-SUFFICIENCY. (a) **CI gate LIVE** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions runs pytest (102) + `manage.py check` on every push/PR (Py3.12, SQLite, ephemeral keys, plain `check` so green=green); first run green. Makes the test discipline self-enforcing — the #1 gap from an external-AI review Mike solicited, which reframed MB as a **credible, evidence-backed internal-tool foundation, not 'vibe-coded'** (verdict: gate > tooling; mypy deprioritized; verified 265 DB-state assertions vs 13 page-load-only across the 102 tests). (b) **`scripts/update.sh`** — one-command, fail-loud, **backup-first** update (pull→pip→migrate→collectstatic→restart→health-poll + rollback hint); verified on staging+prod; Mike self-updates without help. (c) **README.md** drafted for a possible open-source release — honest 'what it is / today + where it could go' framing, repair/work-order wedge, openly **UNDECIDED** on POS/inventory/SMS/other-billing(QBO)/docs/multi-shop (explicitly NOT foreclosed, per Mike); viability desk-check done (real gap for a self-hosted repair/work-order tool — niche but underserved; ITFlow = adjacent competitor + proof-of-demand). (d) **Mac→GitHub over SSH now** (key on scs-tech2026 acct; origin `git@github.com`) — retires the PAT workflow-scope/Keychain friction permanently. (e) Mike's **self-sufficiency bar** recorded: install/update/backup/export WITHOUT Claude; **tagged releases mandatory**; **failed update must AUTO-rollback (code+DB)**; Docker deferred (setup.sh instead). See memory `project_mb_publish_ops_selfsufficiency`. STILL QUEUED: `restore.sh`, data export, `setup.sh`, tagged-releases+auto-rollback, in-app admin Update; publish-remaining = screenshots/LICENSE/secrets-audit/de-Shamrock tweaks (validate demand first). // Session 39 — OBSERVABILITY KEYSTONE shipped, closing the assessment's last red (Domain G): MB now self-monitors — its own operational failures open a **System Alert ticket** (dedicated 'System Alerts' client + admin notification bell) via `core/system_alerts.py` + `manage.py send_alert`, chosen over email because the box can't send system mail. Coverage: app **500s → ticket** (`core/log_handlers.SystemAlertHandler` on the `django.request` logger, production-only, wired in `settings.LOGGING`); systemd **OnFailure → ticket** on all three job timers (`murphys-bench-alert@.service` template + `.service.d/onfailure.conf` drop-ins using `%N`); a daily **disk-usage check** (`scripts/mb_disk_check.sh` + timer); a **backup dead-man's-switch** via healthchecks.io (`HEALTHCHECKS_URL` in `.env`; `mb_backup.sh` pings on success and `/fail` on failure); and **logrotate** for the gunicorn access/error logs (previously unbounded). Migration 0063 (Ticket source 'system' + Notification kind 'system_alert'). Built + validated on the staging VM (201) first, then deployed to prod; suite →102. NOTE: prod sudo is NOT passwordless beyond the gunicorn restart, so the `/etc` unit installs are a Mike-run copy-paste block (documented in `deploy/README.md` → Observability). // Session 38 — built a dedicated TEST/STAGING VM `mb-test` (VMID **201**, `10.58.58.108`, scsprox node): fresh **install-from-git** on Ubuntu 24.04.4 / Py3.12, SQLite, gunicorn(unix socket)+nginx, sla-check timer. Runs a **COPY of prod data under prod's `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** (Mike's Option-1 choice — faithful migration testing) with **all outbound integrations neutralized** (mailbox/Invoice-Ninja/B2/Maps creds blanked in the test DB; fetch-email + backup timers NOT enabled) → a real pre-prod mirror that ends edit-on-prod. **Read-only GitHub deploy key** for `git pull` deploys (deploy: `git pull && migrate && collectstatic && sudo systemctl restart murphys-bench`). 100/100 tests pass + Mike-verified login. ⚠ **Holds REAL client data — keep LAN-only, NEVER repurpose as a demo** (MB2 is the fake-data demo; see memory `mb_test_vm_holds_real_data`). The clean build doubled as an **INSTALL.md shake-out → FIXED** (commit `b1c1856`): missing `mkdir logs/` step (broke every manage.py at startup), Postgres-vs-SQLite defaults, stale gunicorn/nginx snippets (now unix-socket/50M/network.target + EnvironmentFile), dropped unused `psycopg2-binary`, added `static/.gitkeep` (fixes `staticfiles.W004`). ⚠ prod not yet pulled to `b1c1856` (doc/requirements-only, inert — sync at next deploy); dev Mac venv still Py3.9. ALSO **squared away PBS backups** (Mike-driven — the parked learning task, now DONE): resolved the VMID **102/103 collisions** across the two standalone nodes (BookStack 102→**202**, Cloudflared 103→**203**; prod stays 103), purged dead WinXP/ITFlow groups (GC reclaimed **82 GB**), added a daily **verify** job + centralized **prune** (keep 7/4/3), set **both** PVE backup jobs to Selection "All", and **notify-on-failure → opens a ticket** — closes the assessment's PBS red. VMID convention now: scsprox2=1xx, scsprox=2xx (see memory `reference_proxmox_pbs_infra`). // Session 37 — (a) inbound DUPLICATE-TICKET bug FIXED: a leftover user-level scheduler racing the system fetch timer + a non-atomic dedup → atomic Message-ID claim + DB unique constraint + flock run-lock + Message-ID strip (migration 0062, suite →100); (b) full report-only SYSTEM ASSESSMENT across 8 domains (BookStack page 09 + memory `project_mb_assessment_2026_06`): verdict — app/code/data/security are SOUND (verified green), every failure lived in the OPERATIONAL/PROCESS shell; the two reds = NO OBSERVABILITY (keystone — nothing reports failure) and a BROKEN PBS whole-VM backup for prod (VMID-103 collision prunes the real backup); prioritized remediation recorded; Mike to stand up a dedicated TEST VM as real staging. // Session 36 — DB backup FIXED: discovered prod runs on **SQLite**, not PostgreSQL (the old pg_dump dumped an empty Postgres DB — root cause of the long-broken backup). Built a fail-loud SQLite-snapshot + attachments + .env backup → **Backblaze B2** (immutable, Object Lock governance 30d, lifecycle auto-prune), WAL enabled, restore-tested, nightly timer repointed. Decision: stay on SQLite for the SCS instance. Docs swept — prior "PostgreSQL 16 in production" claims were never true and are corrected. // Session 35 — security posture pass. Audited prod (`manage.py check --deploy` + settings) and acted: added **admin user-delete** (self/last-superuser guards) so the leftover test accounts could be removed (Mike deleted them — only `admin` remains); tightened file perms (`.env` 640→600; `protected/`+`backups/` 775→750); upgraded runtime CVE deps **Pillow 10.1→12.2, requests 2.31→2.33, cryptography 48.0.0→48.0.1** (9 CVEs cleared; all 99 tests pass on prod's Py3.12; dev-only pytest/black left pinned). Found: **dev venv is Py3.9 vs prod Py3.12** (couldn't validate upgrades locally → validated on prod). Posture verdict: app layer solid; real gaps are infra — broken DB backup (tracked), plain-HTTP-on-LAN (TLS deferred, Mike gun-shy), SSH/OS hardening (sudo-gated, Mike to pair). Suite 96→99. Discussion queued: TLS, an easy patch/update mechanism, aligning dev Python to prod. // Session 34 — Phase B shipped + verified: one-directional **Invoice Ninja draft push** from a WO. `core/invoice_ninja.py` (requests, v5 API); Settings → Invoice Ninja card (URL + encrypted token + enable) with Test Connection; "Send to Invoice Ninja" button on the WO → POST `/invoices` as a DRAFT from PRICED lines only, IN assigns the number, WO# → `po_number`; find-or-create client (type-aware name; `Client.invoice_ninja_id` link-once); duplicate guard via `WorkOrder.invoice_ninja_id`; fail-loud; ref editable. Disabled by default. Mike configured the live token + ran a real push — works as intended. ALSO: added **work order hard-delete** (admin only) — there was never one; cleans attachment files, reopens a converted ticket, cascades the rest. Migration 0061. Suite 88→96. // Session 33 — Phase A billing primitive shipped: new generic `LineItem` model (GenericFK — WorkOrder now, future Quote later; kind labor/part, qty, unit_price, computed line_total) is now THE billable-work record. Unified `WorkPerformed` INTO it (migrated all rows → labor LineItems, rewired the log/edit/delete UI, deleted WorkPerformed). `QuickLaborItem.default_price` prefills the buttons; WO total shows on detail + repair report; custom entry does labor/part w/ price. MB captures+totals prices, Invoice Ninja stays the billing authority (sets up Phase B push). Migrations 0058/0059/0060. Deployed to PROD (3 WorkPerformed rows migrated cleanly), verified data/service AND browser-verified by Mike. Suite 84→88. ⚠ ALSO corrected a false doc claim: the pg_dump backup never worked (empty dumps) — PBS whole-VM backup is the real safety net; real DB backup tracked as a TODO. // Session 32 — attachment security review acted on: attachments now stored OUTSIDE the web root (`PRIVATE_MEDIA_ROOT=BASE_DIR/protected`) so nginx's /media/ alias can't serve them — the authenticated download view is the only path; download view now authorizes per-object (resolves owning Ticket/TicketReply/WorkOrder/WorkOrderNote + applies visibility scoping, closing an IDOR); inbound email attachments now enforce the blocked-extension list + size cap (untrusted path previously enforced neither). Migration 0057 (state-only), conftest isolates media roots. Deployed to PROD + verified: old /media/attachments URL → 404, auth view → login. Suite 80→84. PROD + MB2 demo both fixed+verified (demo also sits behind Cloudflare Access). // Session 31 — device/WO usability: ticket device dropdown now scopes to the selected client (form queryset + HTMX OOB cascade); Device gained free-text CPU/RAM/storage; WorkOrder snapshots those specs at creation as an "as-serviced" record and syncs edits back to the device master (migrations 0055/0056); device-detail back-link now returns to the device's client instead of the dead-end device list. All live on prod. Suite 71→80. // Prior: Billing-architecture decision — the Invoice Ninja bridge is staged into a priced line-item primitive FIRST (Phase A, generic/attachable line items + WO total + tests — the expensive-to-reverse-with-live-data piece), THEN the IN push (Phase B, draft-push so IN owns invoice assembly). Quote/Project approval layer deferred (additive, no live-data clock). No tax (Oregon). Full rationale in memory `project_mb_pricing_architecture` + `project_in_integration` and in TODO.md "Billing work". // Session 30 — T2/Helpdesk Buttons moved off OSTicket API to T2's Email Connector; MB unwraps the no-reply relay `email-connector@tier2tickets.com` to the real contact via forwarded `From:`; unmatched inbound now parks in an "Unsorted/Unverified" triage bucket (migration 0054, `Client.is_unsorted`) instead of auto-creating junk clients, with an admin dashboard card + `/tickets/?triage=1`. Inbound fully live on the real support inbox. Migrations through 0054; test suite 71 passing. Prod: Claude restarts it directly — NOPASSWD for `systemctl restart murphys-bench`.)
**Gunicorn service**: `murphys-bench.service` — `sudo systemctl restart murphys-bench`
**App path on server**: `/opt/murphys-bench/`

## How We Work On This Project

**Read this section first, every session. It governs everything below it.**

Murphy's Bench is in **daily production use at SCS**. It is past the prototype stage.
That single fact sets the rules below. The owner (Mike) is a non-developer and the
domain expert / director; the AI assistant is the technical director. Mike holds the
*intent*; the assistant holds the *implementation* — and is responsible for flagging when
a request would compromise the codebase's health, not just executing it.

### The prime directive: stabilize before adding
We are in a **stabilization phase**, not a feature phase. Until the spine test suite
exists and the safety guards are in place, **do not build new features** unless Mike
explicitly overrides this. When asked for a new feature, the default response is to
check it against this rule first. Breadth (more features, more configurability) is no
longer the goal; depth (trustworthiness of what already exists) is.

### Non-negotiable habits
1. **Tests are required for anything touching data.** Any change to deletion, billing
   state, ticket/WO lifecycle, email routing, number generation, or permissions ships
   *with* a test that locks in the behavior. No exceptions. Tests are not "later" —
   that era ended when the app went into production. Target the spine, not 70% coverage.
2. **Plan before building anything non-trivial.** Use plan mode. Get the approach
   approved *before* writing code. Most expensive mistakes are "built the wrong thing well."
3. **Review before it goes live.** Run a real review pass on any change touching money,
   credentials, permissions, or data deletion before it reaches the production VM.
4. **Fail loud, not silent.** No new `except: pass` or `fail_silently` that hides a real
   failure. Catch so the user isn't crashed, but log it so we find out.
5. **Every config option is a permanent cost.** Default to a good hardcoded choice.
   Do not add a toggle/setting/custom-field-type until a real user actually needs it.

### Which model does what
Model choice is secondary to the habits above — CLAUDE.md + tests are what keep the
project coherent across sessions, not the model. That said, match model to task:
- **Frontier reasoning model (Opus 4.8 / equivalent)** — planning, architecture
  decisions, code review, gnarly debugging, and "are we on track" check-ins.
- **Sonnet (fast, capable)** — routine implementation: forms, views, templates, CRUD.
- Switch freely; the source-of-truth docs and tests make the handoff safe.

### Known issues to fix first (stabilization backlog, in order)
1. ✅ **DONE (session 27):** `TicketDeleteView` guard fixed — now uses
   `WorkOrder.objects.filter(ticket=ticket).exists()`. Covered by tests.
2. ✅ **DONE (session 27):** `Device.serial_number` now `null=True`; `Device.save()`
   normalizes blank → `None`; migration 0045 converts existing blank → NULL. Covered by tests.
3. ✅ **DONE (session 27):** number assignment is now collision-resistant via
   `_save_with_unique_number()` helper + `save()` override on Ticket and WorkOrder
   (retry-on-IntegrityError, re-reads DB each attempt). Covered by tests.
4. ✅ **DONE (session 27):** silent email/inbound failures now log to the `core` logger
   (lands in `murphys_bench.log`); bad templates also record a failed EmailSendLog. Covered by tests.

**Test harness now exists** (session 27): `pytest.ini` + `core/tests.py` spine suite.
Run with `venv/bin/python -m pytest`. The "tests for anything touching data" rule is now enforceable.

5. ✅ **DONE (session 27):** `reset_operational_data` management command. Surgically
   deletes operational data (clients, contacts, devices, tickets, WOs, mileage,
   attachments+files, logs, non-superuser users) while KEEPING all configuration
   (settings, roles, statuses, help topics, SLA plans, repair types, checklists, canned
   responses, templates, tiles, custom-field *definitions*, KB, org credentials) and all
   superusers. **Dry-run by default**; the destructive path requires the exact phrase
   `--confirm "DELETE ALL OPERATIONAL DATA"`; runs in one transaction. Optional
   `--keep-users a,b`. Covered by tests. This is the clean cutover-from-OSTicket wipe.
   **Never use `manage.py flush`** — it destroys configuration too.
6. ✅ **DONE (session 27):** Production safety guards in settings.py. `DEBUG` now
   defaults to `False` (local dev sets `DEBUG=True` in `.env` — a local `.env` was
   created on Mike's Mac). Startup raises `ImproperlyConfigured` if `DEBUG=False` and
   `SECRET_KEY`/`FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are still the committed defaults. Added
   `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`; `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` + HSTS are opt-in via `.env`
   (HSTS deliberately left off until HTTPS is confirmed end-to-end — it's hard to undo).
   Prod verified already has DEBUG=False + real keys, so the guard passes there.
7. ✅ **DB backup — DONE (Jun 22). The old pg_dump backup dumped an EMPTY Postgres DB; prod actually runs on SQLite. Replaced with a fail-loud SQLite-snapshot + attachments backup to Backblaze B2 (immutable, Object Lock 30d). See docs/bookstack/05-backup-and-disaster-recovery.md.**
   **FIXED (Jun 22).** Root cause: prod runs on **SQLite**, but the old `backup_db.sh` ran `pg_dump`
   against an empty Postgres DB → ~394-byte empty dumps reported as "OK". Replaced with
   `scripts/mb_backup.sh`: a consistent SQLite snapshot + `protected/` + `media/` + `.env` → dated
   tarball, **fail-loud** (integrity + size checks), pushed off-site to **Backblaze B2** (immutable,
   Object Lock 30d), 14 local copies; **restore-drilled from the offsite copy**. (`backup_db.sh` now
   delegates to it.) ⚠️ **PBS whole-VM backup is NOT a working safety net for prod** — a VMID-103
   collision with another VM makes PBS prune the one real murphys-bench backup (found in the Jun 22
   assessment, BookStack page 09; fix is a scheduled hands-on task). Restore needs the tarball **+**
   `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (Bitwarden; the B2 app key + `SECRET_KEY` are in Bitwarden too).

   ✅ **Related gap CLOSED + VERIFIED (session 27):** `fetch_inbound_email` (every 2 min)
   and `check_sla_overdue` (every 15 min) systemd timers (`deploy/`) are **installed and
   active** on the VM. Confirmed working end-to-end: the fetch service ran and connected to the
   mailbox `mail.shamrockcomputerservices.com` over **POP3** (inbound was switched IMAP→POP3 to kill
   a duplication bug). The fetch-email and sla-check timers are `active`/`enabled` and working.
   (The backup timer is active and now produces REAL backups — see item 7 above.)
   ⚠ **One action left for Mike:** the inbound mailbox is `testing@…` — point it at the
   real support inbox in Settings → Inbound Email so customer emails become tickets.

### Going HTTPS (Cloudflare cutover checklist — NOT done yet, deliberately deferred)
The app is currently served over plain HTTP on the LAN (`10.58.58.82`, no domain), so
`manage.py check --deploy` shows 4 HTTPS-related warnings (HSTS, SSL redirect, secure
session cookie, secure CSRF cookie). These are **correct to leave off** until HTTPS is
end-to-end — turning them on now would break internal access. When the Cloudflare tunnel
goes live, flip these together in the production `.env`:
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True`
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True`
- `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=31536000` (only once HTTPS is confirmed everywhere — HSTS is hard to undo)
- add the public hostname to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and set `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://<hostname>`
Then re-run `manage.py check --deploy` — it should come back clean.

### Roadmap re-prioritization (decided this session)
- **Demoted / dropped** (enterprise-shaped or "for someone else," not needed at a solo/small
  shop): Departments, Teams, ticket auto-routing, customer self-service portal, REST API,
  more custom-field types, async email queue, email OAuth2, extra storage backends.
- **Kept small:** Data Management — only the *export* + *soft-delete recovery* halves
  (useful internal safety). Skip the import wizard.
- **The one feature worth pursuing after stabilization:** Invoice Ninja bridge (real SCS
  billing value) — but only *after* the test suite exists, since it moves money.
- **"For others" hygiene** (LICENSE, README, fail-safe settings): cheap, do once when
  convenient, but it does **not** drive feature work. MB becomes useful to others by being
  bulletproof at one shop first — not by adding features for hypothetical users.

### Conversation view (ticket replies) — deliberate rendering (session 27)
`core/templates/core/partials/ticket_reply_item.html` + `reply_body`/`split_reply_quote`
in `mb_icons.py`:
- Reply side is keyed on `reply.created_by`: **empty = inbound client reply** (green,
  shows `ticket.contact` name); set + `internal` = internal note (yellow); set +
  `customer_visible` = staff→customer (blue). Header reads "<who> · <direction>", NOT
  "Customer Visible".
- `reply_body` filter: preserves newlines and **folds quoted email history** (everything
  from the first `>`/`On … wrote:`/`--- Original Message ---` boundary) into a collapsible
  greyed `<details>` blockquote. Content is HTML-escaped before markup is added — don't
  remove the escaping. `split_reply_quote` is unit-tested; keep it pure.
- `strip_quoted_replies` is intentionally OFF in prod (keep the full thread); the quote is
  hidden at display time, not destroyed at ingestion.
- **Reply form deliberate defaults** (`ticket_detail.html`): reply type defaults to
  **Customer Visible** (not internal); textarea is `rows=8` and resizable; the "also send to"
  field has a **BCC/CC selector defaulting to BCC** (`cc_mode` → `send_ticket_email(bcc=…)`);
  the draft **autosaves to `localStorage` per ticket** (`mb_draft_<pk>`) and restores on load,
  so a status-change reload doesn't lose it — cleared on successful submit. Status change is
  still a full POST/reload (the draft autosave is what protects the text; HTMX-ifying it is a
  possible later polish, not needed).

### Email appearance (session 27)
Client-facing HTML emails use `core/templates/core/email/base_email.html` via
`email_utils._build_html_email`:
- **Header text color is auto-computed** (`_contrast_text_color`) from the header bar color —
  never a stored setting. Keeps it readable on any bar color. Don't reintroduce a manual
  text-color field.
- **Logo embeds inline via `multipart/related`** (`msg.mixed_subtype = 'related'`). Without
  that, `cid:logo` doesn't resolve and clients dump the full image as an attachment. The logo
  is downscaled with Pillow (`_load_logo_resized`) and placed above the bar.
- **Email branding is editable** in Settings → Email Templates ("Email Branding" card):
  `email_header_color` + `email_logo` (migration 0046). Both optional — blank falls back to the
  app Title Bar color / company logo via `_email_header_color` / `_email_logo_field`. These are
  decoupled from the app's own colors on purpose.
- Gotcha fixed this session: `reverse` must be imported in `views.py` (it wasn't — 6 settings
  save handlers were latent 500s). Test settings **POST** paths, not just GET.

### Tech experience: visibility scoping + escalation levels (session 27, Jun 12)
The big shift this session — techs no longer see everything. Migrations 0046–0048.

**Nav / dashboard by role** (`is_admin` now in the context processor = staff OR
`can_manage_settings`):
- Sidebar order: Dashboard, Tickets, Work Orders, Clients, KB, then **admin-only** Queues,
  Mileage, Reports. Techs don't see the last three. (Hiding ≠ access control — those URLs
  aren't blocked, just unlinked.)
- Techs get a **"My Mileage"** dashboard card where admins see Team Workload (their mileage
  entry point, since Mileage left their nav).

**Visibility scoping (non-admins):**
- Work orders (`_scope_assignable_for`): own + unclaimed pool. Mileage list: own only.
- Tickets (`_scope_tickets_for`): own + unclaimed + tickets escalated above their owner's
  level up to the viewer's level. Applied to ticket **list, tab counts, AND detail** (a tech
  404s on another tech's ticket by URL). Admins see everything.

**Escalation levels (1–3):** `User.level` (default 1, set in user edit form),
`Ticket.escalation_level` (default 1).
- Tech actions are **Claim / Transfer / Escalate**; admins **Assign**. ("Assign" is a
  dispatcher verb — keep it off the tech view.)
- `Ticket.escalate()` raises to one level **above whoever currently holds it** (an L2-owned
  ticket jumps to L3, not L2). `can_escalate` hides the button when there's nowhere higher.
- **No black hole (Mike's hard rule):** escalating KEEPS the current owner; ownership only
  moves when a higher-level tech **Claims** it. `escalation_pending` = escalated above owner.
- Escalations surface in three places (must stay consistent): ticket detail badge, ticket
  list amber "Escalated → L#" badge, and the dashboard **"Escalated to You"** panel (the
  dashboard ticket queries are level-aware, not just `assigned_to=user`).
- **"New to you":** `Ticket.assignment_unseen` set when transferred/assigned by someone else
  (not self-claim), cleared when the assignee opens it; blue badge on the ticket list.

**Deliberately deferred** (don't build without a reason): retiring `TechSkill` (replaced in
spirit by levels — strip once levels are proven), leveling Work Orders (kept simple), and
bounding the unclaimed pool by level (techs still see all unclaimed).

### Internal tech-to-tech messaging + notification center (session 28, Jun 13)
**One face the client sees — the ticket tech.** The ticket is the single client-facing
channel. A bench tech who needs the client contacted does NOT email/contact the client from
the work order; they message the ticket tech **internally**, and the ticket tech makes the
client contact through the normal ticket reply. (We briefly built the opposite — customer-
visible WO notes emailing the client + mirroring to the ticket — and **reverted it**: it
creates a second client-facing voice. **Do not make WO notes email clients.** Customer-visible
WO notes mean only "shows on the printed repair report" — passive, no email.)

- **`Notification` model** (migration 0051): per-user in-app alerts; generic so future
  producers (escalations, SLAs, assignments) can feed the same bell. `target_url` → linked
  ticket detail else WO detail.
- **`TechMessageView`** (`source='wo'`/`'ticket'`; URLs `wo_message_tech`/`ticket_message_tech`):
  stores the message as an **internal `TicketReply`** in the ticket thread (consolidated
  record), then notifies **directionally** — a WO message targets the ticket tech, a ticket
  message targets the bench (WO) tech. If that target role is **unassigned** → fall back to
  admins (`_notification_admins`, a dispatcher picks it up). If the target role is **held by
  the sender** (one person working both ends) → notify no one (do NOT spam other admins about
  a message sent to oneself). Never notify the sender.
- **Sidebar bell** (`base.html`, new `bell` icon) with a red unread badge from an HTMX-polled
  fragment (`notification_count`, `load, every 60s`). `/notifications/` page: unread-first,
  click → `notification_open` marks read + redirects to target; `notification_read_all`.
- **Affordances:** amber "Message Ticket Tech" card on the WO (only when `work_order.ticket`);
  reciprocal "Message Bench Tech" on the ticket (only when `ticket.work_order_created`).
- **Known gap:** stand-alone WO (no ticket) has no ticket tech → action hidden there.
- Covered by 7 tests in `core/tests.py` (suite at 40 passing).

### Inbound reply threading — converted/closed tickets (session 29, Jun 14)
**Bug found in production:** a client reply to a **converted** ticket (and a closed one)
was falling through and creating a brand-new ticket instead of threading. Root cause was
the status guard in `fetch_inbound_email._process_message`:
`if ticket and ticket.status not in ('closed', 'converted')`. Once a ticket converted to a
WO, the next client reply failed the check → new ticket. The IMAP "leave on server" setting
then re-ran it every poll (forwarded mail had no usable `Message-ID` for the dedup guard),
multiplying one wrong ticket into several (TKT-00008/00009).
- **Fix:** a subject-matched reply now **always threads into its ticket.** Converted tickets
  stay `converted` (just flagged `needs_response` — never un-convert a live WO). Closed tickets
  **reopen to `open`** on reply. The matcher reads the `[TKT-…]` subject token, not headers —
  it never relied on `In-Reply-To`/`References`.
- Covered by 2 regression tests in `core/tests.py` (suite at 43 passing).
- **Mike's side:** switched inbound from IMAP to **POP3 (delete-from-server)** to stop the
  duplication at the source. Tradeoff: MB becomes the only copy of inbound mail — no server
  backup. Inbound is still pointed at `testing@…`; switch to the real support inbox once
  confident (the one open action carried over from session 27).
- The two orphan tickets were reconciled by hand: Wayne's reply was appended to
  TKT-20260610-0001 with its original timestamp, then TKT-00008/00009 were deleted.

### TLS / HTTPS — design decision (DECIDED Jun 20, session 35 — don't re-litigate)
**MB intentionally does not terminate TLS; it runs behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.** This is the standard Django model and is now documented for self-hosters in [`docs/deployment-tls.md`](docs/deployment-tls.md) (linked from INSTALL.md). MB is already proxy-ready: trusts `X-Forwarded-Proto`, hostname via `ALLOWED_HOSTS`/`CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, secure-cookie/HSTS/SSL-redirect are `.env` toggles (off by default so HTTP-on-LAN works, flip on once TLS is in front).

**The decision (after a full discussion with Mike — capture so it's not re-opened; Mike won't remember the reasoning):**
- **Encryption ≠ exposure** — the two are independent. Mike's past Let's Encrypt scare (foreign IPs hammering) was *box exposure* (open ports), not the cert. TLS can be added with zero exposure.
- **SCS network:** 5 segmented LANs. Prod is on the **trusted main LAN** (not internet-reachable). The **VM LAN is untrusted**; MB2 demo lives there behind Cloudflare. External access = move the VM to the VM LAN + Cloudflare (encrypted via the tunnel; no open ports).
- **Resolution for SCS:** prod **stays plain HTTP on the trusted main LAN** — a deliberate, defensible choice (eavesdrop risk needs an attacker already inside the trusted segment; no external surface). **No internal certificate project** — Mike evaluated the subdomain/own-cert/DNS-01 route and concluded (correctly) it's *more* complication than just using Cloudflare, which he reserves `scs-tech.net` for. If prod ever needs external access, it goes behind CF like MB2, inheriting encryption with no cert work.
- **Cloudflare vs a local cert solve different problems:** CF encrypts the *remote/external* path (easy, no ports); a local cert only adds value for *direct LAN* access on an untrusted segment. On a trusted LAN that value is low → not worth the cert hassle.
- **For other people hosting MB:** TLS is a *deployment-docs* matter, not an MB feature — they bring any front door (CF / Caddy / nginx / a subdomain on their own web server / self-signed for LAN). Nobody is forced onto Cloudflare. Covered by `docs/deployment-tls.md`.
- **Still open (separate, real):** the `ufw` host-firewall lockdown on untrusted-LAN boxes (MB2 now) so direct LAN access to the app port is blocked and the tunnel is the only way in — tracked in the security/infra TODO + `project_mb_session35_security`.

### Security posture pass (session 35, Jun 20)
Mike asked for an honest posture read + weaknesses. Audited via `manage.py check --deploy` + settings/user introspection on prod. Verdict: **app layer is solid** (session auth + LoginRequired everywhere, django-axes, role perms + per-object visibility scoping, MFA enforced, AES-256 field encryption incl. the IN token, structurally-private attachments); **the real gaps are infrastructure/operational.** Detail in memory `project_mb_session35_security`.
- **Acted on (live):** added **admin user-delete** (`UserDeleteView`, admin-only, guards against deleting self or the last superuser; SET_NULL FKs keep history) — there was none, which is why Mike couldn't remove the 3 test accounts (now deleted; only `admin` remains). Tightened secret/file perms: `.env` 640→600, `protected/` + `backups/` 775→750. Upgraded runtime CVE deps **Pillow 12.2.0 / requests 2.33.0 / cryptography 48.0.1** (9 CVEs cleared; requests carries the IN token, Pillow processes uploaded logos). Validated by the full suite on prod's Py3.12.
- **Known gaps (ranked) — UPDATED Jun 22 (see BookStack page 09 assessment):** (1) ✅ **DB backup FIXED** (SQLite snapshot → immutable B2, restore-drilled). Both former infra reds are now **CLOSED**: **(1a) observability** — ✅ session 39 shipped self-monitoring (operational failures open a System Alert ticket); **(1b) PBS whole-VM backup** — ✅ fixed Jun 22 (VMID 102/103 collisions resolved → BookStack 202 / Cloudflared 203, prod stays 103; daily verify + centralized prune) and **verified healthy Jun 24** (prod `vm/103`: 4 retained backups, Verify State All OK, no collisions). *(Open low-pri follow-up: PBS VM backups aren't client-side encrypted at rest — the whole-VM image includes prod's `.env`/`FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in clear; fine on the trusted LAN.)* (2) **Plain HTTP on the LAN** — session cookies/credential-vault reveals cross the LAN in cleartext; the 4 `check --deploy` HTTPS warnings are correctly env-gated off because there's no TLS. Mitigated by LAN-only. **TLS deferred — Mike is gun-shy** after a past Let's Encrypt exposure; the safe path is DNS-01 on a subdomain resolving to the *private* `10.x` IP (no open ports, no public front door), but it stays off the table until he decides. (3) **SSH/OS hardening (sudo-gated, Mike to pair):** key-only SSH, fail2ban, OS patch cadence — biggest infra lever; contains the "secrets live on the box → VM compromise = full exposure" risk. (4) No inbound-attachment malware scan (ClamAV) — named, deferred. (5) **dev Py3.9 vs prod Py3.12** divergence — folds into the "easy patch/update" discussion.
- **CSP — next hardening step (Jun 23 2026):** the front-end is now fully self-hosted (no CDN), so a Content-Security-Policy is finally feasible — but NOT a quick toggle. Blockers to a *strict* CSP: (1) Alpine v3 evaluates directives via `new Function()` → needs `script-src 'unsafe-eval'` unless we migrate to Alpine's CSP build (rewrites every `x-data`/expression); (2) inline `<script>` blocks (e.g. base.html pre-paint script) need per-request nonces via middleware; (3) inline `style="..."` attributes are pervasive → `style-src` will likely need `'unsafe-inline'`. Plan: **report-only CSP first** (log violations on mb-test, decide the Alpine question with data), then enforce. Its own session. See memory `project_mb_tailwind_cdn_security`.
- **Discussion queued (Mike wants to understand first):** TLS options, an easy patch/update mechanism (align dev Python to prod + a repeatable pip-audit→upgrade→test-on-3.12 loop).

### Phase B — Invoice Ninja draft push + WO delete (session 34, Jun 20)
The billing loop closes: MB hands IN clean priced lines; **IN stays the authority** (assigns the number, owns assembly + payment). One-directional, user-triggered, fail-loud. Built on Phase A's LineItems. Shipped + live-verified (Mike configured the token and ran a real push). Suite 88→96. Detail in memory `project_mb_session34_phase_b` + `project_in_integration`.
- **`core/invoice_ninja.py`** — `requests`-based IN v5 client. `test_connection()`; `in_client_name` (type-aware: business=Client.name, residential=primary contact full name — avoids invoicing a residential client as their bare last name); `find_or_create_client` (stored id → email match → create; saves `Client.invoice_ninja_id`, link-once-don't-sync; comment warns IN replaces the whole contacts array on POST/PUT); `push_work_order` → `POST /invoices` as a **draft** (omit `number` → IN assigns; WO# → `po_number`) from **priced lines only** (unpriced excluded; blocks if none priced). Stores returned IN id+number on the WO. All failures raise `InvoiceNinjaError`, surfaced to the user; on failure nothing is saved (clean retry).
- **Config:** `SiteSettings.invoice_ninja_enabled / _url / _token` (token encrypted). Settings → Invoice Ninja card + Test Connection. **Disabled by default.** Mike's instance: **Cloud Enterprise, `https://invoicing.co`** (self-hosting was evaluated + rejected — see `project_in_integration`).
- **WO detail:** "Send to Invoice Ninja" → flips to "Invoiced → #NNNN" with a warned **Re-send**; duplicate guard is WO-scoped (`WorkOrder.invoice_ninja_id`). `invoice_ninja_ref` is editable (inline WO edit) to record drift if a draft merged into a different final invoice in IN.
- **Deferred (named, not built):** on-demand payment-status check; email-on-push (create-only by design); the **Square-as-IN-gateway** zero-code companion win (config in IN, not MB). Quote/Project approval layer still deferred (additive, no live-data clock).

### Work order hard-delete (session 34, Jun 20)
There was **never** a way to delete a work order (only tickets had one) — found when Mike couldn't delete cancelled WO-00008. Added `WorkOrderDeleteView` (admin only) + "Delete WO" toolbar button (admin only, confirm dialog). Deletes attachment **files** from storage first (rows cascade with the WO but files don't), reopens a linked **'converted'** ticket so it isn't orphaned, then cascades line items/notes/items/invoice. **Mileage entries survive** (work_order SET_NULL — travel log, not WO-owned). Warns in the success message if the WO had been pushed to IN (a draft may still exist there). Tests: cascade + ticket reopen, 403 for non-admin.

### Phase A — priced line-item primitive (session 33, Jun 20)
First step of the billing roadmap (memory `project_mb_pricing_architecture`). The schema gap that's expensive-to-reverse-with-live-data, so it lands before the Invoice Ninja push. Deployed to prod; suite 84→88.
- **`LineItem`** (new, generic/attachable via GenericFK so a future Quote reuses it; `db_table='line_items'`): `kind` labor/part, `description`, `quantity`, `unit_price` (nullable = unpriced), computed `line_total` (None when unpriced), `source_labor_item` FK→QuickLaborItem (for the report's print-description fallback), `logged_by/at`. `WorkOrder.line_items` GenericRelation (cascades on WO delete) + `line_items_total` property (sums priced lines, ignores unpriced).
- **Unify (Mike's call):** `WorkPerformed` was migrated INTO `LineItem` and **deleted**. Migration 0059 copies every WorkPerformed → labor LineItem (price blank — price-less history isn't backfilled), 0060 drops the table. The log/custom/edit/delete endpoints + the Work Performed UI now operate on LineItem. View class names + URL names kept (`work_performed_*`) to avoid churn — they now act on LineItem.
- **`QuickLaborItem.default_price`** (optional) prefills a labor line's price when the button is clicked. New Default Price column in Settings → Quick Labor.
- **UI:** WO detail Work Performed section shows labor + parts with per-line qty/price + a running Total; custom-entry form gained kind (labor/part) + qty + price; repair report prints priced lines + total. **No "estimate" label** — Mike didn't want it (he's unconcerned about the UI implying authority; the boundary is enforced by Phase B pushing a *draft* to IN).
- **Authority boundary intact:** MB captures + totals prices; Invoice Ninja stays the system of record. Phase B (the IN draft-push) builds on these priced lines. See `project_in_integration`.
- **Migration gotcha (fixed):** the data migration uses `ContentType.objects.get_or_create` + an early-return on empty DB, because ContentTypes aren't populated mid-migration on a fresh build (test DB).

### Attachment security review — acted on (session 32, Jun 20)
Audited inbound/served attachment handling against a 4-point checklist; found and fixed real issues. All live on prod + verified; suite 80→84. Memory `project_mb_attachment_security_review` + `project_mb_session32`.
- **🔴 Found: attachments were publicly served.** nginx had `location /media/ { alias .../media/; }` → every file under `media/attachments/...` was reachable by URL with **no login**, bypassing the auth download view (paths guessable: sequential ids + original filename). Prod is LAN-only so LAN-exposure; **MB2 demo is internet-facing** (see below).
- **Structural fix (not a band-aid):** attachments now stored under `PRIVATE_MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR/protected`, **outside MEDIA_ROOT**, via `PrivateMediaStorage` (FileSystemStorage subclass resolving `location` dynamically so tests isolate it; passed as a callable to stay out of migrations). nginx structurally can't serve them — the authenticated `AttachmentDownloadView` is the only path. No nginx edit needed (the dir it aliased is now empty). Existing files relocated `media/attachments → protected/attachments` per deploy target (one-time, manual).
- **🟠 Fixed IDOR:** `AttachmentDownloadView` now calls `_can_access_attachment()` — resolves the owning Ticket/TicketReply/WorkOrder/WorkOrderNote and applies `_scope_tickets_for`/`_scope_assignable_for` (admins see all). A tech can no longer fetch any attachment by id past the ticket-visibility scoping.
- **🟠 Fixed inbound parity:** `fetch_inbound_email._save_attachments` now enforces the blocked-extension list + size cap (the UNtrusted path previously enforced neither, while manual upload did); skips are `logger.warning`, not silent.
- **Kept-safe (today):** the download view forces `as_attachment=True` for everything → no inline XSS via emailed `.html`/`.svg`. Content-sniffed inline image rendering is deferred to the widget's screenshot feature (must sniff by content, never the attacker-supplied `mime_type`).
- **✅ MB2 DEMO (10.58.35.223) — DONE same day:** pulled to current, migs 0054–0057, restarted, verified (404 on old /media path, 302 app). 0 files to relocate. Demo is also behind Cloudflare Access (every request 302s to CF auth first) → double-gated. No outstanding attachment-security work on either box.
- **Deferred ceiling (named, not done):** malware scanning of inbound attachments (ClamAV); optional nginx `deny /media/attachments/` as belt-and-suspenders; force-download protects the browser session, not the tech's machine (endpoint AV's job).

### Device/WO hardware specs + navigation fixes (session 31, Jun 20)
Usability pass surfaced while onboarding Unsorted tickets and entering device data. All live on prod; suite 71→80.
- **Ticket device dropdown scoped to client** — onboarding an Unsorted/Unverified ticket no longer shows
  every device in the system. `TicketForm` scopes the `device` queryset to the effective client (same
  pattern as `contact`), and the client→contacts HTMX cascade (`TicketContactsByClientView`) now also
  returns an **out-of-band `<select id="id_device">`** so the device list re-narrows live on client change.
- **Device hardware specs** — added free-text `cpu`/`ram`/`storage` to `Device` (migration 0055). Free
  text on purpose (MSP values vary too widely to constrain; structured number+unit deferred unless
  sorting/filtering is needed). Shown on the device form ("Hardware Details") + device detail; OS is now
  also displayed on detail (was captured, never shown).
- **WO snapshot + sync-back** (migration 0056) — `WorkOrder` gained `cpu`/`ram`/`storage`. On creation
  (`save()` when `_state.adding`, via `apply_device_specs()`) the WO copies the device's specs as an
  **as-serviced** record — covers the create view, ticket-convert, and any programmatic create. Editing
  specs on the WO syncs back to the device master (`sync_specs_to_device()` from `WorkOrderUpdateView`);
  reassigning the device on the inline panel re-snapshots (`apply_device_specs(force=True)`). Past WOs
  stay frozen — later device edits don't rewrite history. Shown on WO form/detail/print. Only the
  *mutable* specs are snapshotted; manufacturer/model/serial stay live read-through (device identity).
  **Note:** existing devices/WOs are blank until filled; snapshot only fires on new WO creation.
- **Device-detail back-link fix** — "← Devices" landed on the device list, a dead end (Devices isn't in
  the nav). Now reads "← <client>" and returns to the device's client (client-centric model). The device
  list is still reachable from the dashboard "Devices on File" tile — kept by choice, no nav entry needed.

### T2/Helpdesk Buttons ingestion + Unsorted triage bucket (session 30, Jun 19)
**Tier2Tickets is the button-press front door, moved off OSTicket's API onto T2's Email Connector.**
T2 posts every button ticket from a fixed no-reply relay **`email-connector@tier2tickets.com`** with
the real end user carried in a **forwarded `From:` header inside the body** (plus report/remote links,
hostname, username, businessName, `[message]`, `[selections]`). Subject is `Fwd: E.xxxxx <subj>` —
that `E.xxxxx` is T2's own ticket ID (kept on purpose; clients are told it) and does NOT match MB's
`TICKET_RE`, so button tickets always create a new ticket, never mis-thread.
- **Adapter** (`fetch_inbound_email`): when the envelope sender ∈ `_T2_RELAY_ADDRESSES`,
  `_extract_forwarded_sender(body)` parses the first `From:` line **from the raw body before quote
  stripping**, and resolution runs on the REAL address. Unparseable → fall back to the relay address
  **and `logger.warning`** (fail loud). Blocked-sender + Message-ID dedup checks run *after* the unwrap
  so they apply to the real sender. **The reliable identity key is the contact email, not businessName**
  (businessName is first-use-only at SCS). T2 is ingestion-only — once the ticket exists, replies flow
  support-email ↔ contact directly; MB needn't know T2 was involved. Device/hostname extraction was
  deliberately deferred.
- **Unsorted/Unverified triage bucket** (migration 0054): an unmatched inbound sender no longer
  auto-creates a junk named client. The old per-person/free-email + domain-grouping fallback is GONE
  (`_FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS` deleted). Instead `Client.is_unsorted` + `Client.get_unsorted()` route the
  ticket under one system "Unsorted / Unverified" client (real name/email still kept on the contact for
  reply routing + onboarding). A configured `inbound_default_client_name` catch-all still overrides.
  **Never hide a ticket** — it's visible and workable; only the *client record* is held pending triage.
  Surfacing: admin dashboard card "Unsorted — needs triage: N" → `/tickets/?triage=1` (indigo banner).
  Bucket is excluded from the Active-Clients stat and **cannot be deleted/deactivated** via the UI.
  **Onboard** = existing Edit-ticket reassignment (change client → contact dropdown cascades);
  **reject** = existing ticket delete + Settings → BlockedSenders (v1; no combined button). Policy is
  uniform for ALL unmatched inbound, not just T2. `reset_operational_data` wipes the bucket with
  everything else and `get_unsorted()` recreates it lazily on the next unmatched inbound.

### Design intent to preserve (don't "fix" these — they're deliberate)
- A completed Work Order must **never** auto-close its Ticket. The ticket drives the
  human-facing interaction and a person resolves it manually after real contact.
  `AUTO_RESOLVE_TICKET_ON_WO_CLOSE` stays off by default. This is the *non-action* we keep —
  it does not force a human to do anything, it just declines to close automatically.
- **REMOVED Jun 28 2026 (Jim's challenge, Mike agreed):** the old *hard block* that prevented
  closing a ticket while its linked WO was still open. That was MB imposing a workflow opinion —
  how a shop sequences ticket-close vs WO-completion is the shop's policy, not the software's. Any
  authorized tech can now close a ticket regardless of linked-WO state, in both close paths
  (`TicketUpdateView.form_valid` + `TicketStatusUpdateView`). No warning/flag was added (it would
  just be noise). Locked by `test_ticket_with_open_wo_can_be_closed`. Keeping the auto-close
  *non-action* above is still correct — that's distinct from the removed block.
- A Work Order does **not** require a Ticket — work doesn't always arrive that way. But if
  a ticket came first, it also owns the last interaction.

## Vision & Philosophy

Murphy's Bench is **internal-first, self-hosted software** for small field service businesses (MSPs).

### Core Principle
Build one thing well: a self-hosted repair tracking system that runs on a business's internal network. Other companies can self-host it on their infrastructure.

### Workflow
```
Ticket (intake + replies) → Triage → Work Order (repair) → Notes/Checklist → Closed → Invoice Ninja
```

### Phase 1: SCS Internal (Current)
- **Focus**: Get SCS's workflow working perfectly
- **Scope**: Ticketing, work orders, device tracking, mileage, email integration, reporting
- **Deployment**: Internal network
- **Success**: SCS techs prefer this to the legacy PHP app

### Phase 2: Integrations & Polish (Future)
- Org-level credentials vault (OrgCredential + CredentialAccessLog)
- Device-level credentials (password field on Device, encrypted)
- Email Template Manager UI, Status Management UI, Data Management (import/export/deleted/reset)
- Financial reporting (invoiced/paid/outstanding by client)
- Invoice Ninja API bridge
- Email OAuth2 (Gmail/Office 365)
- Departments, Teams, Auto-routing
- Customer self-service portal
- REST API (for Taskbar Utility App / Clover integration)

### Phase 3+: Multi-Tenancy (Speculative)

---

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.12 / Django 5.2.15 LTS
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS (compiled & self-hosted at `static/css/app.css` via the standalone CLI — `scripts/build_css.sh`, `tailwind.config.js`; built on deploy, no Node), HTMX + Alpine.js (self-hosted/pinned in `static/js/`). **Fully CDN-free as of Jun 23 2026** — including the admin reports page (Chart.js 4.4.0 + html2pdf 0.10.1 also vendored to `static/js/`).
- **Database**: SQLite (dev and production — a single file, no DB server; the only supported DB)
- **Auth**: Django session auth + django-two-factor-auth (TOTP), LoginRequiredMixin on all views

### Data Models (51 current, migrations through 0078)

> Full field-level detail is generated in [`docs/database-schema.md`](docs/database-schema.md).
> The list below is a conceptual summary — see that file for fields/types. Models added
> since the original list: `RepairTypeCategory`, `ContactPhone`, `StatusDefinition`,
> `LineItem` (the universal priced-line primitive — `WorkPerformed` was unified into it
> and deleted), `OrgCredential` + `CredentialAccessLog`, `DeviceCredentialAccessLog`,
> `MFAResetLog`, `EmailSignature`, `BlockedSender`, `CannedResponseCategory`, `Prospect`,
> `Estimate`, `Sale`, `EstimateOption` (comparative pricing choices on one quote — a
> fourth `LineItem` host alongside WorkOrder/Estimate/Sale).
- **Role** — permission role with 16 boolean flags; seeded: Administrator, Technician
- **TechSkill** — skill tags M2M on User; captured for future skill-based routing
- **User** — extended Django user; role CharField (legacy) + role_obj FK to Role + skills M2M
- **Client** — company/customer
- **Prospect** — thin sales lead (customer spine), captured contact-first; `client_type` at entry, 5-stage pipeline; `promote_to_client()` creates a Client + primary Contact (mig 0066)
- **Contact** — person at a client company
- **Device** — equipment being serviced; `client` nullable (mig 0075, session 61) — a walk-in/anonymous device is a real permanent row with no owning Client, never piles onto a shared placeholder
- **SLAPlan** — response deadline config (grace_period_hours, overdue alerts toggle)
- **HelpTopic** — ticket classification with optional default SLA
- **Ticket** — initial service request; statuses: new, open, in_progress, waiting_on_customer, resolved, closed, converted
- **TicketReply** — threaded conversation on a ticket (customer_visible or internal)
- **WorkOrder** — repair job; service_type (in_shop/onsite/remote); time_spent_minutes; linked to originating ticket via OneToOne; `client` nullable (mig 0075, session 61) — walk-in WOs show "Walk-in (anonymous)", same pattern Sale already used
- **WorkOrderNote** — customer-visible or internal notes on a work order
- **WorkOrderItem** — checklist items, parts, time entries
- **Invoice** — billing state tracker; OneToOne on WorkOrder; billing_status enum (uninvoiced/invoiced/paid/paid_direct/disputed); amount, dates, payment_method, notes; auto-created on WO creation via signal; also carries `invoice_ninja_id`/`in_status`/`in_status_checked_at` (read-back, mig 0067)
- **Estimate** — priced quote (Lane A — Planned/sales); anchors to exactly one of Client/Prospect; `EST-NNNNN` numbering; status draft/sent/accepted/declined/expired; reuses `LineItem` GenericRelation for its own ("General", renamable via `general_label`) line items; full lifecycle (quote PDF/email, accept→WorkOrder, decline+reason, revise) shipped Slices 2a–2c (migs 0068/0069); create+edit collapsed to one page (mig-free, session 59); optionally carries `EstimateOption` children (comparative pricing choices — session 59, migs 0073/0074)
- **EstimateOption** — a named, self-contained pricing option nested under an Estimate (e.g. "Budget"/"Standard"/"Premium"); reuses `LineItem` GenericRelation as its own host; `total` sums only its own lines; `is_selected` mutually exclusive per estimate via `select()`; rejected options stay on record, nothing deleted
- **Sale** — counter/walk-in sale (Lane B — Counter); `client` nullable (an anonymous walk-in still pushes to IN under a standing "Walk-In" client when IN is enabled — see Slice 3b); no `contact` field (removed mig 0072 — Mike's call, a counter sale doesn't need a per-sale contact, the receipt covers it); `SALE-NNNNN` numbering; status draft/completed/void; reuses `LineItem` GenericRelation as a third host alongside WorkOrder/Estimate; checkout (payment_method/amount/paid_at/reference) + IN-tracking trio live since Slice 3b; Customer card (Client/Notes) auto-saves, no separate edit page (mig 0070-0072)
- **Mileage** — travel logging; trip_type (one_way/round_trip); optionally linked to WorkOrder
- **RepairType** — category (Laptop Repair, Desktop Repair, etc.)
- **Checklist** — template task list linked to a repair type
- **ChecklistItem** — individual task in a checklist template
- **CannedResponse** — template notes for common situations
- **TicketLock** — collision avoidance; OneToOne on Ticket, 10-min expiry
- **TicketLink** — links related/duplicate tickets; unique_together on (ticket_a, ticket_b)
- **SiteSettings** — singleton; SMTP, inbound email, attachment config, Google Maps API key + shop address, require_mfa toggle
- **Attachment** — GenericFK to Ticket/TicketReply/WorkOrder/WorkOrderNote; local or S3 storage
- **EmailTemplate** — trigger-based outbound email templates (4 triggers, seeded with defaults)
- **SuppressedAddress** — exact email addresses that never receive automated email
- **EmailSendLog** — audit trail for every outbound send attempt
- **InboundEmailLog** — audit trail for every inbound message fetched
- **Notification** — per-user in-app alert (sidebar bell + unread count); first producer is internal tech-to-tech messaging; generic for future producers
- **KBCategory** — knowledge base category (admin-managed)
- **KBArticle** — KB article; types: troubleshooting / how_to / vendor / internal; is_restricted flag
- **TicketQueue** — Saved ticket filters; owner=null = system queue; filter_criteria JSONField
- **DashboardTile** — Configurable dashboard tile; row (ticket/workorder), status_filter, visible_to
- **CustomField** — Admin-defined extra fields for Tickets or Work Orders; scoped to HelpTopic or RepairType
- **CustomFieldChoice** — Options for select-type CustomFields
- **CustomFieldValue** — EAV storage: one row per (object, field) pair; GenericForeignKey

## Ticketing System Design

See `docs/ticketing-design.md` for full detail.

### Ticket Statuses
`new` → `open` → `in_progress` → `waiting_on_customer` → `resolved` → `closed`
Also: `converted` (converted to Work Order — read-only after this point)

### Ticket → Work Order Rules
- A ticket linked to an open WO **can** be closed/resolved — MB does not block it (the old hard
  block was removed Jun 28 2026; sequencing is the shop's policy, not the software's opinion)
- When the WO closes, ticket shows a prompt: "WO complete — ready to resolve" — tech closes manually
- `AUTO_RESOLVE_TICKET_ON_WO_CLOSE` admin setting (default **off**)
- Ticket remains in system after conversion — full history retained

---

- **P2**: Credentials on WO (masked), Client Type badge (Residential/Business), Multiple phones per Contact (Alpine.js dynamic rows), Contact notes + receives_email, Invoice Ninja Ref # deferred to Phase 2
- **P3**: Native Settings UI at `/settings/` — 6 tabs: Company, Outbound Email, Inbound Email, Attachments, Security, Mileage

### ✅ Batch 11 — Foundational Client-Centric Rebuild (sessions 10–11 — COMPLETE)

Full spec in `docs/batch-11-plan.md`. Identified by complete side-by-side audit of the legacy
PHP app (SCS Repair Tracker) vs Murphy's Bench. Core problem: Murphy's Bench treats Clients,
Contacts, Devices, and Work Orders as peer objects. The legacy app — and correct workflow — is
**client-centric**: everything flows through the client.

**Priority 1 — Device + Client Hub:**
- Device model: add `os`, `os_version`, `condition_at_intake`, `assigned_contact` FK, "Save & Create WO" button. Remove Device from top-level nav.
- WorkOrder: add `contact` FK (nullable) — "whose WO is this?" Shown in WO History, WO detail header, WO create/edit form.
- Client detail as hub: single-column layout, per-contact "+ WO" button, inline device add, phone custom label + type dropdown, inline client type edit, Set Primary Contact.
- Client edit: Deactivate (block if WOs on delete) + Permanently Delete (type-to-confirm).

**Priority 2 — WO Detail + Print:**
- Unified black action toolbar: View Client | Edit Client | Edit Device | Edit WO | WO History | Repair Report | Claim Ticket | Email Report | Status ▼
- Client info + Device info (OS, serial, condition) on WO page.
- Days Open counter, Completed Date, Invoice Ninja Ref #.
- Work Performed entries show bold label + description + timestamp.
- Pre/Post Checklist collapsed by default. Credentials "+ Add note" field.
- Repair Report: add OS/version/condition, note timestamps, signature lines, footer.
- Claim Ticket: same template, `?type=claim` changes title only.

**Priority 3 — Native Settings UI Expansion:**
- Repair Types: native CRUD with categories + ▲/▼ reorder. Needs new `RepairTypeCategory` model.
- Canned Responses: two Note Streams (Customer Notes / Tech Notes Internal), categories per stream, CRUD, picker on WO detail.
- Quick Labor: native CRUD (currently Django admin only).
- Checklist Items: model change — flat bank scoped by device type (not per-repair-type). Migration required.
- Status Colors + Site Colors: hex inputs + live preview, stored in SiteSettings, rendered as CSS variables in base.html.
- Company Info: split address into Line 1, Line 2, City, State, Zip (both SiteSettings and Client model). Report Header Preview.
- Display Settings: browser-local UI preferences (localStorage) — nav/sidebar/content font size, card density (Compact/Normal/Comfortable).

**Decisions locked in session 9:**
- Permanently Delete blocks if client has WOs; offers Deactivate instead
- Address: 5 fields (Line 1, Line 2 optional, City, State, Zip) — no country field
- Existing address data migrates to Line 1; user cleans up manually
- Colors stored in SiteSettings; rendered as `<style>` block of CSS variables in base.html
- RepairTypeCategory model needs to be created with sort_order field
- Device assigned_contact: server-side queryset filter (client_id from URL param); no HTMX cascade needed (standalone Device page being removed)

### ✅ Session 13 — Cross-Visibility + Bug Fixes (session 13 — COMPLETE)

- **Cross-visibility panels**: Open tickets panel on WO detail; open WOs panel on ticket detail — status, last note/reply preview, one-click navigation
- WO detail toolbar: linked ticket shown as clickable purple pill (← TKT-XXXXX)
- Converted tickets stay visible in sidebar, dashboard "My Open Tickets" tile, and cross-visibility panels until resolved/closed
- History tab removed from ticket detail (consistent with WO detail)
- Sidebar: shows last reply/note preview instead of subject/description; falls back gracefully if no notes
- Mileage Calculate button: fixed CSRF token for production (was silently failing in prod)
- Google Maps API confirmed working from production server (WAN IP restriction set in Cloud Console)

### ✅ Session 26 — HTML Email, Signatures, Inbound Fixes (session 26 — COMPLETE)

- **HTML email + signatures**: `EmailMultiAlternatives`, `base_email.html` with header/body/signature/footer. `EmailSignature` model (migration 0044), per-template FK override, default fallback. Settings → Email Templates has full signature CRUD.
- **CID inline logo**: Logo read from disk, attached as `MIMEImage Content-ID: logo`. Falls back to company name text. Switches to public URL when Cloudflare is live.
- **Quick status change on ticket detail**: dropdown + Set in Quick Actions; `TicketStatusUpdateView`.
- **Ticket client reassignment fix**: uses POSTed `client` value for contact queryset.
- **Residential client labels**: Alpine.js reactive label swap on client form.
- **Free email domain fix**: `_FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS` — Gmail/Yahoo/etc. get per-person clients.
- **Inbound threading fix**: `TICKET_RE` matches sequential numbers (`TKT-00005`).
- **Security hardening**: django-axes, proxy SSL headers, CSRF trusted origins, Lax cookie, password min 12.
- **Inbound email timer**: systemd units written to `/tmp` — Mike to install with sudo.

### ✅ Session 22 — UI Polish, Dark Mode, KB Markdown (session 22 — COMPLETE)

- **Search bars inline**: Tickets, Work Orders, Clients, Mileage, KB lists — filter controls moved into page header bar. Fixed missing technician options in WO assigned_to dropdown.
- **Mileage decimal fix**: `floatformat:1` on total miles display.
- **Ticket reply type**: Radio buttons instead of dropdown. Removed redundant "Add Reply ↓" Quick Actions button.
- **KB Markdown rendering**: `markdown` library, `markdownify` template filter, Tailwind typography plugin (now compiled into the self-hosted stylesheet). Articles render headings/bold/lists/code/tables from pasted `.md` files.
- **KB Categories in Settings**: Native CRUD tab — no Django admin needed.
- **Dark mode**: Per-user toggle in sidebar footer (moon/sun icon), persisted to `localStorage`. CSS override strategy in `base.html` covers all common surfaces, text, borders, inputs, tinted panels (blue-50/yellow-50/green-50), prose.
- **My Work sidebar removed**: Was redundant in practice.
- **Dashboard stat cards**: Active Clients + Devices on File are now clickable links.
- **Reports page overhaul**: Per-section CSV/Print/PDF dropdowns in header. Print uses hidden iframe (no popup tab). PDF uses html2pdf.js. Mileage miles floatformat:1 in template and CSV.

### ✅ Session 21 — Ticket Contact FK, Email Fixes, User/Role Management (session 21 — COMPLETE)

- **Ticket contact FK** (migration 0037): `Ticket.contact` nullable FK to `Contact`. Reply emails route to `ticket.contact.email` first, fall back to primary contact. Inbound emails auto-set contact from matched sender.
- **HTMX contact cascade on ticket form**: Client select dynamically loads contacts. Endpoint: `GET /tickets/contacts-by-client/?client=<id>`.
- **Reply resend**: Each customer-visible reply has a "Resend" button — pick any client contact or type a custom address.
- **CC on replies**: Reply form shows a CC field (comma-separated) when Customer Visible is selected.
- **Native User management**: `/users/new/`, `/users/<pk>/edit/`, `/users/<pk>/set-password/` — full CRUD, no Django admin needed.
- **Native Role management**: `/roles/` — list with ✓/✗ permission grid, create/edit/delete. 17 permission flags. System roles protected.
- **Users + Roles in Settings sidebar**: Both at the bottom of Settings nav, with "← Settings" back links.
- New template filters: `attr` (getattr on model), `getfield` (form[name]) — in `mb_icons.py`.

### ✅ Session 20 — Vertical Left Sidebar Nav (session 20 — COMPLETE)

- **Replaced horizontal top nav** with fixed left sidebar (`w-64` expanded / `w-16` collapsed to icon-only)
- **Logo** fills sidebar header at top (no company name text alongside it)
- **8 primary nav links** with icons: Dashboard (home), Work Orders (list), Clients (building), Tickets (ticket), Queues (funnel), Mileage (map-pin), KB (book-open), Reports (chart-bar). All `text-base` with active-page highlight.
- **My Work section** (HTMX accordion with tickets + WOs) integrated into scrollable sidebar middle — always loaded, hidden when collapsed
- **Footer**: Admin (admin-only → `/settings/`), Log Out. Security removed from sidebar.
- **Collapse toggle** (chevron) at bottom — state persisted to `localStorage`; pre-Alpine inline script + CSS attribute (`data-sidebar-collapsed`) prevents layout flash on page load
- **8 new icons** added to `mb_icons.py`: `home`, `map-pin`, `chart-bar`, `funnel`, `chevron-left`, `book-open`, `shield`, `logout`
- No model/migration changes. Deployed to production.

### ✅ Session 19 — Status Management UI (session 19 — COMPLETE)

- **`StatusDefinition` model**: `entity_type` (ticket/workorder), `slug`, `label`, `color` (hex bg), `is_system`, `sort_order`, `is_active`
- **Migration 0036**: AlterField removes choices= from Ticket.status and WorkOrder.status (max_length→50); seeds 13 core statuses with default colors; RunPython after CreateModel
- **Template tag suite** in `mb_icons.py`: `status_badge`, `status_label`, `status_color` — 2-min module-level cache, graceful fallback for unknown slugs. `invalidate_status_cache()` called after any CRUD change.
- **11 templates updated**: all hardcoded status badge `{% if status == ... %}bg-X{% endif %}` patterns replaced
- **WorkOrderForm + TicketForm**: status field overridden in `__init__` to load choices from StatusDefinition — custom statuses appear in dropdowns automatically
- **WorkOrderListView, TicketListView, WorkOrderDetailView**: pass status choices via context
- **Settings → Statuses tab**: two tables (Ticket / Work Order), color picker on each row, inline edit form (Alpine.js toggle), custom status add form at bottom, system statuses get "Edit Color" only
- **email_utils.py**: `status` context var resolved via StatusDefinition instead of `get_status_display()`
- Migration 0036 applied to production; all changes live

### ✅ Session 18 — Device Credentials Vault (session 18 — COMPLETE)

- **Device-level credentials**: `device_username`, `device_password`, `credential_notes` (AES-256 encrypted) added to `Device` model
- **`DeviceCredentialAccessLog`** model — logs every reveal (field + user) and edit
- **`can_view_device_credentials`** flag on `Role` (Administrator=True, Technician=False by default, configurable)
- **HTMX eye-reveal card** on device detail right column — masked by default, eye icon triggers HTMX GET, logs access
- Admin always sees edit form (Alpine.js toggle). Users with flag can reveal. Others see "contact admin" message.
- Migration 0035 applied to production. Administrator role seeded on prod.

### ✅ Session 17 — Phase 2 Foundations (session 17 — COMPLETE)

- **Invoice CSV export**: `InvoiceExportView` at `/clients/<pk>/invoices.csv` — all invoices for a client, optional `?status=` filter. CSV button on client detail WO History header.
- **Icon audit**: 10 new icons added to `mb_icons.py` (x-mark, exclamation-triangle, lock-closed, user, key, document-text, chevron-up/down/right, arrow-down-tray, eye). All emoji/text symbols replaced across templates. Fixed arrow-down-tray silently rendering nothing.
- **Billing financial summary on Reports page**: Invoiced/Collected/Outstanding metric cards + outstanding-by-client table with CSV links. Billing CSV export at `/reports/csv/billing/`.
- **Org credentials vault**: `OrgCredential` + `CredentialAccessLog` models (migration 0034). Settings → Credentials tab. AES-256 encrypted username/password/notes. HTMX eye-reveal logs every access. CRUD with admin-only flag. Every view/edit/delete written to audit log.
- **Email Template Manager**: Settings → Email Templates tab. Native UI for all 4 `EmailTemplate` triggers. Editable subject/body (monospace), active toggle, variable reference panel (`{% verbatim %}`), last-updated timestamp. Auto-creates inactive defaults on first visit.
- **Team workload widget**: Dashboard (admin only) — Team Workload table showing open WOs + tickets per tech, sorted by total load, counts link to filtered lists.
- **Technician performance report**: Reports page — WOs in period, completed count, completion % (color-coded), avg resolution hours, current open WOs. CSV export at `/reports/csv/tech_perf/`.
- **Doc sweep**: MB_UI_UX_Analysis.md content merged into CLAUDE.md + TODO.md. Stale admin panel entries cleaned up.
- Production deployed: migration 0034 applied, all changes live.

### ✅ Session 16 — Invoice Model (session 16 — COMPLETE)

- **`Invoice` model**: OneToOne on WorkOrder (`db_table = 'invoices'`). Fields: `billing_status` (uninvoiced/invoiced/paid/paid_direct/disputed), `amount`, `invoiced_date`, `paid_date`, `payment_method`, `notes`
- **Signal**: `post_save` on WorkOrder auto-creates Invoice on WO creation
- **Migration 0033**: CreateModel + `backfill_invoices` RunPython for existing WOs; applied to production
- **`WorkOrderBillingUpdateView`**: HTMX POST. Quick-action mode (just `billing_status`): updates status + auto-sets dates on first transition. Full edit mode (`full_edit=1`): updates all fields. Returns `billing_card.html` partial.
- **`billing_card.html`** partial: display mode shows status badge + amount + dates + quick-action buttons (contextual per status). Edit mode (Alpine.js toggle): full form. HTMX `hx-swap="outerHTML"` on `#billing-card`.
- **WO detail**: billing card inserted in right column between "Update Work Order" and "Device Credentials"
- **Client detail**: outstanding balance badge (yellow pill) next to "Work Order History" heading — sum of `uninvoiced`+`invoiced` WO amounts
- URL: `/work-orders/<pk>/billing/` → `wo_billing_update`
- Production deployed: migration 0033 applied, Gunicorn reloaded

### ✅ Session 15 — Visual Polish (session 15 — COMPLETE)

- **Color-coded dashboard tiles**: left-border accent per status (Blue=active, Yellow=waiting, Red=overdue, Green=completed). Color computed in `_tile_color()` from `status_filter` and `link_url`.
- **SVG icons replacing emoji**: all dashboard tiles and quick stats row now use Heroicons outline via `{% icon name size %}` templatetag (`core/templatetags/mb_icons.py`)
- **Device type icon grid**: replaced Device Type dropdown on device form with 2-row × 4-col Alpine.js button grid (Laptop, Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, Server, Printer, Other). Selected state highlighted blue.
- Migration 0032: data migration converting emoji icon values → icon name strings in DashboardTile
- Production deployed: migrations 0031 + 0032 applied, `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set in prod `.env`, Gunicorn reloaded

### ✅ Session 14 — Credential Encryption + Billing Architecture (session 14 — COMPLETE)

- **Credential encryption (migration 0031)**: `WorkOrder.device_username`, `device_password`, `device_pin`, `credential_notes` and `SiteSettings.email_password`, `inbound_password` now AES-256 encrypted at rest via `django-encrypted-model-fields` (Fernet symmetric encryption)
- `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` added to `murphys_bench/settings.py` — reads from env, dev fallback only
- `encrypted_model_fields` added to INSTALLED_APPS and `requirements.txt`
- `.env.example` updated with key generation instructions and warning
- RepairShopCRM comparative UI/UX analysis completed — documented in `MB_UI_UX_Analysis.md`
- **⚠️ Production deployment of migration 0031 is PENDING** — must set `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production `.env` BEFORE pulling. Must be done together. See `memory/project_credential_encryption_deploy.md`.

### ✅ Batch 12 — Production Deployment + WO Detail Polish (session 12 — COMPLETE)

**Deployment:**
- Ubuntu 24.04 VM on Proxmox (10.58.58.82), SQLite, Gunicorn + Nginx, systemd
- Python 3.12 (Ubuntu 24.04 default), SSH key auth, config data migrated via dumpdata/loaddata

**WO Detail improvements:**
- Inline editing: Device card (reassign device), Details card (repair type, assigned to, scheduled date, contact, invoice ref)
- Custom repair type on the fly (＋ Custom… option in Details edit, get_or_create)
- Attachment upload form in Attachments tab (WorkOrderAttachmentUploadView)
- History tab removed from WO detail
- Work Performed redesign: editable entries (pencil/trash SVG icons), custom log form, collapsible Log Work buttons

**Settings additions:**
- site_logo (ImageField), color_nav_text, color_sidebar_bg, color_sidebar_text in SiteSettings
- ColorSettingsForm expanded; base.html CSS variables updated; sidebar uses opacity-based text hierarchy
- Font size dropdowns (px values stored in localStorage)
- Client list redesigned to match legacy app layout (ACCOUNT/TYPE/CONTACT/PHONE/EMAIL/DEVICES/WOs)

### Remaining / Future
- **Testing suite** (deferred — will write after real-world use surfaces actual edge cases)
- **Cloudflare tunnel** — ✅ LIVE for the **demo** instance (MB2, `10.58.35.223`) at
  `https://mbdemo.scs-tech.net`, gated by Cloudflare Access (Mike + Jim). Internal prod
  (`10.58.58.82`) stays LAN-only/unexposed by choice. See `~/Documents/Claude/MB2-Cloudflare-Setup.md`.
- **MFA reset hardening** — ✅ DONE + deployed (migration 0053, Jun 18). `MFAResetLog` audit record
  on every reset (shared `reset_user_mfa()` helper); `can_reset_user_mfa` Role flag gates the web
  view (`_can_reset_mfa` = superuser OR flag); `manage.py reset_mfa <username>` break-glass that
  auto-stamps the shell identity (os-user + SSH source IP) into the audit note rather than logging
  an anonymous null actor — the CLI is the highest-risk path so it's made traceable, not faceless.
  Seed flags admin roles on; log read-only in Django admin; 5 tests. Live on demo; prod
  migrated+seeded (prod restart pending). NOT building admin tiers. See `project_mb_mfa_reset_hardening`.
- **Login/logo branding** — ✅ LIVE on **prod + demo** (migration 0052). `login_logo` field +
  Settings upload; login page renders it (fallback to text), logo wrapper decoupled from the form
  (`max-w-[640px]`, logo max-height 560px, form pinned `max-w-md`); sidebar uses ratio-preserving
  fit (232px wide, 160px cap, hide when collapsed) replacing the old hard-coded 90px crush; upload
  guard rejects >2000×2000 (3 tests). See memory `project_mb_login_branding`.
- **Repair report fixes (Jun 18, live on both)** — `WorkOrderPrintView` 500'd on custom Work
  Performed entries (`labor_item=None` → `.category` AttributeError); now grouped under "Other",
  template shows `custom_label`/`notes` for custom entries, regression test added. Print page's
  return link now **closes** the new print tab instead of opening a 2nd WO tab. (Prod restart for
  the cosmetic tab-close change may still be pending — confirm `git log` HEAD is `4942f22`.)
- **Site-wide icon audit** — replace remaining text symbols (×, etc.) with SVG icons

## Key Decisions Made

- **Front-end asset delivery — fully self-hosted, no CDN (Jun 23 2026):** HTMX (1.9.12) + Alpine (3.15.12) pinned in `static/js/` (commit `e445fdd`), and Tailwind moved off `cdn.tailwindcss.com` to a **compiled self-hosted stylesheet** `static/css/app.css` (commit `63d9421`) built by `scripts/build_css.sh` (pinned standalone Tailwind v3.4.19 CLI, no Node; cached in gitignored `.tailwind/`; `app.css` is gitignored and **built on deploy** — `update.sh` runs the build before collectstatic, and any manual `git pull` deploy MUST run `scripts/build_css.sh` before collectstatic). Trigger: Privacy Badger blocking `unpkg` had broken the app on a real laptop. ⚠ The `{% icon %}` tag builds size classes dynamically in Python, so `tailwind.config.js` **safelists** `(w|h)-(3..16)` — keep that if adding new icon sizes. The admin **reports page** Chart.js (4.4.0) + html2pdf (0.10.1) are also vendored to `static/js/` — nothing loads from a CDN anywhere now. See memory `project_mb_tailwind_cdn_security`.
- **LoginRequiredMixin on all views** — app is internal-only
- **WorkOrder free-text problem**: `WorkOrder.reported_problem` (TextField, mig 0064) is the freeform "Reported Issue / Work Requested" — for work that doesn't fit a predefined `repair_type` plus ad-hoc client asks. Bench-editable; works on standalone WOs (no ticket). `TicketConvertView` carries `ticket.description` into it (it was silently dropped before). Shown on WO form/detail + the repair report ("Problem / Task"). `repair_type` is optional, not the only way to state the issue. See memory `project_mb_wo_reported_issue`.
- **Work order numbers** auto-generated as `WO-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`
- **Ticket numbers** auto-generated as `TKT-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`
- **SQLite for dev and production** — the only supported DB (decision Jun 21; the unused Postgres option/branch was removed Jun 28, the dead servers decommissioned)
- **Visual polish** — shipped session 15: color-coded dashboard tiles, SVG icons replacing emoji, device type icon grid
- **GitHub**: Private repo, push after each working feature
- **HTMX** for inline interactions (notes, replies, checklist toggling)
- **No Celery/async queue** — synchronous email sending is sufficient at MSP scale
- **No OAuth2** for email — SCS uses cPanel-hosted mail with standard IMAP/POP3 credentials
- **Single unified KB** — not split between tickets and work orders
- **Ticket close is always manual** even when linked WO closes — a completed WO never auto-closes its ticket (`AUTO_RESOLVE_TICKET_ON_WO_CLOSE` off). But MB does **not** block a human from closing a ticket whose WO is still open — that sequencing is the shop's policy (old hard block removed Jun 28 2026)
- **MFA backup codes for admin only** — other users recover via admin reset
- **SLA overdue alerts are in-app only** — acknowledgment with required note creates audit trail
- **Attachment storage Phase 1**: local filesystem (configurable path) + S3-compatible
- **Alpine.js** self-hosted in `static/js/` (pinned 3.15.12) loaded with `defer` — required for sidebar accordion (was CDN until Jun 23 2026)
- **Sidebar**: HTMX-loaded on every page except dashboard; admins see all, techs see own
- **`?assigned_to=me` filter**: works on both `/tickets/` and `/work-orders/`; admins see all
- **Credential encryption**: AES-256 via `django-encrypted-model-fields`. `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` read from env. Never plaintext. Migrations 0031 + 0032 applied to production (June 9, session 15). Key stored in Bitwarden.
- **Billing philosophy**: MB tracks billing state only — not an accounting module. Lightweight `Invoice` entity on WorkOrder (not fields on WO directly). `billing_status` enum: uninvoiced / invoiced / paid / paid_direct / disputed. `paid_direct` = cash/walk-in before formal invoice. Invoice Ninja and other systems remain authoritative for formal financials.
- **Visual design is a first-class requirement**: Color + icons communicate status faster than text. Not optional polish.
- **Modals for quick edits, full pages for complex creation**: Settings section edits, status changes, mark-as-paid → modal. New Ticket, New WO, New Client → full page form.
- **Soft-delete everything**: Hard deletes require deliberate admin action (type-to-confirm). No silent permanent deletes in normal operation.
- **Export-based integrations**: CSV export works with any accounting system. No live API sync until there is clear demand. More flexible and future-proof.
- **Org-level credentials vault is a competitive advantage**: RepairShopCRM has device-level credentials only, no audit trail. MB's org vault + access log is a differentiator — build it properly in Phase 2.
- **Status color convention**: Blue = In Progress/Active, Yellow = Waiting on Customer, Red = Overdue/Urgent, Green = Completed, Gray = New/Unassigned.
- **Audit log gotcha**: `changes_dict` can contain an `'items'` key that shadows `dict.items()` in Django templates. Always use `_audit_entries()` from views.py — never iterate `changes_dict.items` in templates.
- **Queue filter_criteria**: JSON dict with optional keys: `status` (list), `assigned_to` (int or null), `overdue` (bool), `client` (int), `help_topic` (int), `sla_plan` (int). The `assigned_to: null` key (explicit null, not absent) means "unassigned only".
- **Google Maps mileage**: API call is server-side via `MileageDistanceView` — key never sent to browser. Tested working in architecture; needs verification on internal server (outbound HTTPS required).
- **Service type on WorkOrder**: in_shop / onsite / remote. `+ Mileage` button appears on WO detail only when service_type == onsite.
- **two_factor template overrides** live in root `templates/two_factor/` (in DIRS), NOT in `core/templates/` — DIRS takes priority over APP_DIRS in Django's template loader.
