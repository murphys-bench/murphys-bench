# Murphy's Bench

**Status**: Phase 1 Active Development — Ready for Internal Deployment
**Tech Stack**: Python 3.11 / Django 4.2 / HTMX / Alpine.js / Tailwind CSS (CDN)
**Deployment Model**: Self-hosted on internal network (not cloud, not SaaS)
**Repository**: `~/Documents/Claude/murphys-bench` + GitHub (private)
**Last Updated**: June 8, 2026 (end of session 10)

- `/settings/` — Native Settings UI (admin only, 6 tabs)

**What still requires admin panel:**
- Managing checklists and canned responses
- Email template editing (EmailTemplate model)
- Suppressed address management (SuppressedAddress model)
- Email send/receive log review (EmailSendLog, InboundEmailLog — read-only)
- SLA Plans, Help Topics, KB Categories (admin-managed)
- Roles and TechSkills management
- QuickLaborItem management (add/edit/retire quick labor buttons)

**Note**: All routine workflow actions (create client, work order, device, contact) now use native app pages. The Django admin is staff-only config/reference only.

## Vision & Philosophy

Murphy's Bench is **internal-first, self-hosted software** for small field service businesses (MSPs).

### Core Principle
Build one thing well: a self-hosted repair tracking system that runs on a business's internal network. Other companies can self-host it on their infrastructure.

### Workflow
```
Ticket (intake + replies) → Triage → Work Order (repair) → Notes/Checklist → Closed → Invoice Ninja
```

### Phase 1: SCS Internal (Current)
- **Focus**: Get SCS's workflow working perfectly
- **Scope**: Ticketing, work orders, device tracking, mileage, email integration, reporting
- **Deployment**: Internal network
- **Success**: SCS techs prefer this to the legacy PHP app

### Phase 2: Integrations & Polish (Future)
- Invoice Ninja API bridge
- Email OAuth2 (Gmail/Office 365)
- Departments, Teams, Auto-routing
- Customer self-service portal
- REST API (for Taskbar Utility App / Clover integration)
- Visual design polish

### Phase 3+: Multi-Tenancy (Speculative)

---

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11 / Django 4.2.30
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS (CDN), HTMX, Alpine.js
- **Database**: SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (planned for production)
- **Auth**: Django session auth + django-two-factor-auth (TOTP), LoginRequiredMixin on all views

## Ticketing System Design

See `docs/ticketing-design.md` for full detail.

### Ticket Statuses
`new` → `open` → `in_progress` → `waiting_on_customer` → `resolved` → `closed`
Also: `converted` (converted to Work Order — read-only after this point)

### Ticket → Work Order Rules
- A ticket linked to an open WO **cannot** be closed/resolved — hard block
- When the WO closes, ticket shows a prompt: "WO complete — ready to resolve" — tech closes manually
- `AUTO_RESOLVE_TICKET_ON_WO_CLOSE` admin setting (default **off**)
- Ticket remains in system after conversion — full history retained

### ✅ Batch 11 — Foundational Client-Centric Rebuild (session 10 — Priority 1 + 2 complete; Priority 3 in progress)

Full spec in `docs/batch-11-plan.md`. Identified by complete side-by-side audit of the legacy
PHP app (SCS Repair Tracker) vs Murphy's Bench. Core problem: Murphy's Bench treats Clients,
Contacts, Devices, and Work Orders as peer objects. The legacy app — and correct workflow — is
**client-centric**: everything flows through the client.

**Priority 1 — Device + Client Hub:**
- Device model: add `os`, `os_version`, `condition_at_intake`, `assigned_contact` FK, "Save & Create WO" button. Remove Device from top-level nav.
- WorkOrder: add `contact` FK (nullable) — "whose WO is this?" Shown in WO History, WO detail header, WO create/edit form.
- Client detail as hub: single-column layout, per-contact "+ WO" button, inline device add, phone custom label + type dropdown, inline client type edit, Set Primary Contact.
- Client edit: Deactivate (block if WOs on delete) + Permanently Delete (type-to-confirm).

**Priority 2 — WO Detail + Print:**
- Unified black action toolbar: View Client | Edit Client | Edit Device | Edit WO | WO History | Repair Report | Claim Ticket | Email Report | Status ▼
- Client info + Device info (OS, serial, condition) on WO page.
- Days Open counter, Completed Date, Invoice Ninja Ref #.
- Work Performed entries show bold label + description + timestamp.
- Pre/Post Checklist collapsed by default. Credentials "+ Add note" field.
- Repair Report: add OS/version/condition, note timestamps, signature lines, footer.
- Claim Ticket: same template, `?type=claim` changes title only.

**Priority 3 — Native Settings UI Expansion:**
- Repair Types: native CRUD with categories + ▲/▼ reorder. Needs new `RepairTypeCategory` model.
- Canned Responses: two Note Streams (Customer Notes / Tech Notes Internal), categories per stream, CRUD, picker on WO detail.
- Quick Labor: native CRUD (currently Django admin only).
- Checklist Items: model change — flat bank scoped by device type (not per-repair-type). Migration required.
- Status Colors + Site Colors: hex inputs + live preview, stored in SiteSettings, rendered as CSS variables in base.html.
- Company Info: split address into Line 1, Line 2, City, State, Zip (both SiteSettings and Client model). Report Header Preview.
- Display Settings: browser-local UI preferences (localStorage) — nav/sidebar/content font size, card density (Compact/Normal/Comfortable).

**Decisions locked in session 9:**
- Permanently Delete blocks if client has WOs; offers Deactivate instead
- Address: 5 fields (Line 1, Line 2 optional, City, State, Zip) — no country field
- Existing address data migrates to Line 1; user cleans up manually
- Colors stored in SiteSettings; rendered as `<style>` block of CSS variables in base.html
- RepairTypeCategory model needs to be created with sort_order field
- Device assigned_contact: server-side queryset filter (client_id from URL param); no HTMX cascade needed (standalone Device page being removed)

### Remaining Before Deployment
- **Batch 11** — foundational rebuild (see above + `docs/batch-11-plan.md`)
- **Testing suite** (deferred — will write after real-world use surfaces actual edge cases)
- **Deployment** — internal network, HTTPS, PostgreSQL, backup strategy

---

## Key Decisions Made

- **Tailwind via CDN** — no build step needed for now
- **LoginRequiredMixin on all views** — app is internal-only
- **Work order numbers** auto-generated as `WO-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`
- **Ticket numbers** auto-generated as `TKT-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`
- **SQLite for dev** — switch to PostgreSQL for production
- **Visual polish deferred** — functionality first
- **GitHub**: Private repo, push after each working feature
- **HTMX** for inline interactions (notes, replies, checklist toggling)
- **No Celery/async queue** — synchronous email sending is sufficient at MSP scale
- **No OAuth2** for email — SCS uses cPanel-hosted mail with standard IMAP/POP3 credentials
- **Single unified KB** — not split between tickets and work orders
- **Ticket close is always manual** even when linked WO closes — forces human contact
- **MFA backup codes for admin only** — other users recover via admin reset
- **SLA overdue alerts are in-app only** — acknowledgment with required note creates audit trail
- **Attachment storage Phase 1**: local filesystem (configurable path) + S3-compatible
- **Alpine.js** loaded via CDN in base.html with `defer` — required for sidebar accordion
- **Sidebar**: HTMX-loaded on every page except dashboard; admins see all, techs see own
- **`?assigned_to=me` filter**: works on both `/tickets/` and `/work-orders/`; admins see all
- **Audit log gotcha**: `changes_dict` can contain an `'items'` key that shadows `dict.items()` in Django templates. Always use `_audit_entries()` from views.py — never iterate `changes_dict.items` in templates.
- **Queue filter_criteria**: JSON dict with optional keys: `status` (list), `assigned_to` (int or null), `overdue` (bool), `client` (int), `help_topic` (int), `sla_plan` (int). The `assigned_to: null` key (explicit null, not absent) means "unassigned only".
- **Google Maps mileage**: API call is server-side via `MileageDistanceView` — key never sent to browser. Tested working in architecture; needs verification on internal server (outbound HTTPS required).
- **Service type on WorkOrder**: in_shop / onsite / remote. `+ Mileage` button appears on WO detail only when service_type == onsite.
- **two_factor template overrides** live in root `templates/two_factor/` (in DIRS), NOT in `core/templates/` — DIRS takes priority over APP_DIRS in Django's template loader.
