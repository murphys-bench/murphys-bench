# Changelog

All notable changes to Murphy's Bench are recorded here, newest first.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are the
tags cut by `scripts/release.sh` and deployed by `scripts/update.sh`.

## v0.4.43 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Sales nav link restored.** `/sales/` (counter/walk-in sale history) had no sidebar
  entry — reachable only by clicking a "Register →" button on another page — and the
  Reports section that was meant to surface it instead was never built. A reviewer
  couldn't find the page at all. Sales now has its own sidebar link.

## v0.4.42 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Register (Light POS)**: the "recently completed" list from v0.4.41 could sort the
  newest work order to the bottom instead of the top. `completed_date` is only stamped
  by `WorkOrder.mark_completed()` — a WO completed through any other status-change path
  has it NULL, and sorting straight on that column mixed dated and undated rows
  unpredictably. Now falls back to the WO's creation time when `completed_date` is
  unset, so newest is always first. Also capped the list to a fixed scrollable height
  so a full 25-row list doesn't push "Start New Sale" off screen.

## v0.4.41 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Install docs**: `INSTALL.md` no longer runs the full pytest suite as part of
  "Initialize the Application" — running hundreds of tests isn't part of bringing the
  app up, it's an optional health check. Moved to its own "verify the install" note.
- **Register (Light POS)**: the register's search screen only ever showed a work order
  if you typed a search term — a walk-in or unnamed-client job had no way to be found
  short of guessing its exact client name (e.g. the system "Unsorted / Unverified"
  bucket). It now lists the most recently completed work orders by default, so any
  finished job can be found by browsing instead of searching blind.
